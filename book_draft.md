# Preface

I do not want to be writing this. There are a number of things I’d much rather be doing. The future (world of bits) will be built out somewhere whether it be the US, Israel or a collection of expat communities living a nomadic existence in the sun. It almost certainly won’t be the UK and hence writing this seems like a complete waste of my time. Why not just write it off as a (very large) sunk cost and focus on the future? But what person would I be if I left the equivalents of younger me to rot in the same (or worse) circumstances that I rotted in? I feel like I have a responsibility to those equivalents of younger me in a way that no one took responsibility for the prospects of actual younger me. Hopefully it will make a difference to someone. At the very least it will leave me with a clearer conscience.

## 1 Why don't you commit suicide?

In Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search For Meaning the preface describes the author-psychiatrist asking his patients “Why do you not commit suicide?”. It is a question I’ve struggled with for over a decade now even though I only recently opened this book. I still don’t have an answer. The best I can come up with is to not to disappoint G*d. But the world has been cripplingly disappointing to me from closest family and friends to my country to strangers I’ve asked the smallest favor from. Although the popular narrative is that slavery was ended and Jewish prisoners were freed from concentration camps it feels to me like neither has happened. It feels to me that slavery and concentration camps have just been expanded and franchised to include most of the world without people realizing. Arguably small pockets still exist where smart people are encouraged to be ambitious and work together to solve problems, create riches and that trite “change the world”. But even those pockets seem to end up being trashed or embroiled in wars after a period of time and I wasn’t able to gain long term access to those places regardless. If anything this state of affairs is even worse mentally and psychologically than the original. At least with slavery and concentration camps everyone could see with their own eyes where they were, could relate to each other and build relationships based on a shared reality. Imagine being in a concentration camp and trying to convince your fellow prisoner that they were even in a concentration camp in the first place. If they don’t ever venture to the mental walls of their cell the prospect seems farcical to them. 

The cruelty of prison guards can vary hugely from prison to prison. I think they are especially cruel in the UK. To start with UK citizens’ freedoms are curtailed to a much greater extent in comparison to say US citizens. There is only one game in town and that is the state. You are forced to rely on the state for everything from your physical protection to your health and a large part of the population also relies on the state for their livelihood. The state continues to demonstrate that it is either completely incompetent, malicious or both and nothing happens. Whether that be destroying the economy with years of Covid lockdowns, lying to its population that new vaccines don’t present risks or frightening its population that leaving a large bloc of nations (EU) was existential the state proves over and over and over again that it is totally useless. You would expect that most people who succeed in the state know this and they’ve long given up on any sense of patriotism or national service and they are purely there because it is the only way to enrich themselves.

Assuming that the hypothesis is right and you’re in a prison without a specified term what should one do?  Try to make a rush for the escape? Buckle down and try to make the most of it? Try to chip away at your prison walls month by month Shawshank Redemption style? I’ve tried the first option. I’ve tried to get US citizenship and I’ve tried to get Israeli citizenship. Although theoretically nothing is impossible those prospects don’t seem promising currently without anyone in a position to provide assistance. Do I have any evidence to suggest the UK will change or provide more hope in the coming years? Absolutely zero. If anything I think it will get worse as it has decade on decade. Once the state objective becomes managed decline and clinging to the US to maintain relevance it becomes harder and harder to turn that oil tanker around. Although Brexit briefly provided a spark of hope and a potential launchpad to change direction that spark was very quickly snuffed out by the state, Covid and politicians who were more than happy to do the state’s bidding in gaslighting the UK population.

So that leaves the options of buckling down and chipping away at the walls. For me buckling down is sharpening the tools that should be valuable in an idealized world where you were allowed to use those tools. The digital world (the world of bits) is only two or three decades old which is absolutely nothing in comparison to the millennia of the world of atoms. Chipping away at the walls is this book. I may personally never escape but my attempts to chip away could lead to someone in the future continuing where I left off. When I look at a photo of me as a young boy I pity him for what he’s still got to go through. If there’s a similar young boy out there today with similar aspirations, similar intelligence and similar hope that he can make something of himself one day hopefully he can pick up the chipping where I left it and maybe even make it to the other end.

## 2 UK royalty and the nepotism leakage

The UK media acts as if the royal family is paying them millions of dollars per day to ensure full page spreads like advertisers do. They will ask inane questions like “Is that the end for Meghan and Harry?” knowing full well that they will continue to cover their every movement, appearance and business venture ensuring that they continue to have relevance in the mindshare of their readers for the rest of their lifetimes. Why is the obvious question. An innocent capitalistic motivation would be that their readers have an unhealthy obsession with Meghan and Harry and they are merely serving up what their readers and customers want. An innocent patriotic like motivation would be that nothing else is happening in the country and the only thing that the UK has anymore that the rest of the world pays attention to is the royal family. Hence keep promoting the only asset the UK has in an attempt to attract eyeballs and attention overseas. Maybe there is some truth in those innocent explanations. But the more malign explanation is that the royal family is a critical piece of the state and the state wants to keep the population distracted with meaningless stories. The state doesn’t want the population to be informed, it doesn’t want the population focusing on their own lives and working hard to better their lives. It wants the population to stay captive to the state and with that objective the more helpless and the more useless the population becomes the better. Become 24/7 experts on the movements of Meghan and Harry and you are of no use to anyone other than as a brainwashed tool for the state.

I have always been split on UK royalty. In one sense it is a symbol of longevity and the merits of maintaining traditions and principles that prevented the turmoil and chaos that engulfed other nations when they threw out those traditions and principles. But in another sense it entrenches the nepotism and the quashing of ambition from the head of state down. If you could somehow maintain the symbol of longevity and tradition without it leaking into every facet of society and poisoning what theoretically should be a capitalistic, meritocratic and striving society it would be a net asset. But it leaks. The fawning over people who don’t seem to have any particular talents, insights or achievements other than they were born to the right people happens everywhere. Other than sport and until recently entertainment (both conveniently keeping the population on the sofa) which do at least show repeated examples of individuals rising from all walks of life to the top of their industries you’d be hard stretched to find an industry where who you were born to and who you know wasn’t a 100x predictor on future success over intelligence or innate ability. But who you know isn’t entirely determined by who you were born to, right? No it isn’t. But compare Individual X who went to the highest fee paying school to Individual Y who went to the local state school. Individual X not only meets other wealthy, influential people at home through dinner parties and such like, he is now meeting the only people who have a chance of being wealthy and influential in the future, the children of parents who are wealthy and influential. The only chance Individual Y gets of meeting the Individual Xs is at a top university where Individual Y somehow overcomes the odds of passing the admission tests without Individual X’s expensive tuition. Then enter the sense of superiority, the expensive wardrobe, the access to the most exclusive members clubs and the best Individual Y can hope for is to be kept around for the amusement. All this to meet individual Xs who may not have much intelligence or innate ability and probably aren’t motivated by anything because they have already have everything. So what was the point?

A reoccurring theme of this book will be what I wish I’d been told when I was young and what I wish didn’t take me two decades of my life to realize. The fact that it has taken me this long is a complete failure of my family, friendship groups, education system, national media, political system and indeed my country. Although I also have to take a large chunk of the responsibility the fact that no one in any facet of my life could point me in the right direction and that no one else was pursuing these same questions just shows how effective the state has been at ruthlessly sucking up any sense of ambition in anyone who wasn’t born into wealth and influence. 

## 3 The star upon the hill

I definitely visited Israel later than I should have. When I try to dissect the reasons for only visiting in 2019 the UK media certainly played a large part. You’d struggle to find one TV program or one news report in the UK on the beauty and aspiration of the Israeli project. It was a never ending diet of terrorist attacks and military responses, supposedly warmongering Israeli leaders and innocent, helpless Arab victims in Gaza and the West Bank being unnecessarily carpet bombed. The worst perpetuator was the BBC, that supposed perfectly neutral paragon of virtue that I and everyone else in the UK is forced to fund under the threat of jail. It certainly seems that populations in Gaza and the West Bank have been radicalized against Israel and Jews generally but the BBC and other UK media outlets have done their best over the years to follow their example in the UK. When I see the anti Israel and anti Jewish sentiment in the UK in 2024 I see it is an inevitable consequence of the brainwashing from the BBC and other slightly less extreme UK media outlets that you could probably group as an entity within the UK “state”.

However I personally have to take a large part of the responsibility myself. Why didn’t I want to explore my Jewish identity on my father’s side? Why didn’t I think more about and study religion and religious texts more? When I repeatedly passed through these phases of hopelessness why didn’t I explore religion and the work of religious leaders? I don’t know. Neither of my parents were religious and being caught between two religions (in my case Judaism and Christianity) I ended up exploring neither. But that is on me. My upbringing and the tools of the state definitely played a part but I really should have been stronger and not been a victim to circumstance here.

Regardless of how long it took to me to get there my impressions of Israel shifted nearly 180 degrees on visiting. Is there a terrorist threat and military responses that result in death and injury that would sadden anyone with a heart? Undoubtedly. But to focus exclusively on that at the expense of the positive is like focusing entirely on G*d’s seeming indifference to suffering in the bible and ignoring the act of creation in the first place. The story of the Israeli nation state is a modern day miracle. Take one of the most heinous attempts to wipe out a race and a religion in human history (the Holocaust) and turn it into a rebuilding of the land of the Jewish people that they have yearned to return to for millennia. I will get into the Herzl vision, the military victories against the odds, the leaders who took Israel to a stronger position than the position they found it and the honing of the skills that will ensure Israel’s future but even ignoring all that. Is there anything that better embodies the human spirit than turning unbearable pain and suffering into something beautiful? A truly existential threat to the future of a race and a religion that wiped out a third of its global population and turning that into a beacon of hope? In the land of Abraham, Moses and Jesus? A mere mortal (or at least the vast majority of mere mortals) couldn’t imagine it.

## 4 Dancing when others can’t hear the music

One of the most endearing details I read when first exploring Israel on a Birthright trip was accounts of Theodor Herzl traipsing round wealthy Jewish benefactors such as the Rothschild family effectively pitching for funding for a new Israeli nation state in the 19th century decades before it was formed and at a time when the prospect seemed farcical. For a nation state that over a century later would be labelled the “Startup Nation” for its incubation of disproportionately successful technology startups. Not only would Herzl not see that but he didn’t really see any fruits of his labor as he died in 1904 with the nation state of Israel only being formed in 1948. Now he has a Mount named after him in Jerusalem with his tomb at the top but during his lifetime he was undoubtedly dismissed as a crank rather than a visionary. Is that a happy or a sad tale for him personally? Depends on your priorities I guess. Would you rather live an affluent lifestyle and ensure your descendants live an affluent lifestyle or would you prefer to play a part in the history of your people regardless of whether you see any personal benefit in your lifetime? The vast majority would choose the former but that might change on their deathbed or on a meeting with their maker. David Goggins, the American retired Navy Seal and ultramarathon runner has talked in his books about the role that future meeting plays in motivating him. Can you do anything that brings you closer to G*d than attempting godlike feats down here on earth before your own light goes out? 

It sounds simple but it is anything but. Every single force especially in a country like a UK in 2024 is pulling you in the opposite direction towards mediocrity and being an obedient servant to the state. In times when the state is itself ambitious and competent, trying to manage a global empire or attempting to emerge victorious from a world war that might work well. But in times when the state stands for nothing other than managed decline and is determined to drag its citizens into the abyss with it there is nothing worse. You can’t overthrow it, it is becoming harder and harder over time to exit and if you fail to exit it will drag you and your descendants into a state of permanent poverty and hopelessness.

At this point I’m not sure why nearly every Jew in the UK and other countries around the world doesn’t have a passport to the only Jewish nation state on the planet even if it is held merely as a hedge against future waves of antisemitism in their home country. You only have to have a basic grasp of history to understand that domestic economic troubles or international military conflicts often drive these waves of antisemitism as the state looks for individuals or groups of individuals to pass the blame to. In addition in the UK there has been a large influx of Arab, Muslim immigrants (both legal and illegal) that threatens to change societal and political dynamics and hence the potential safety of Jews in the UK for generations. Perhaps others will encounter what I did where UK rabbis block UK citizens from using Israel’s The Law of Return’s grandparent clause to obtain an Israeli passport. But not trying seems neglectful to me. UK rabbis will have to ultimately answer to their maker on why they are choosing to block those attempts with UK safety concerns rising but it is otherwise hard to speculate on their reasons for doing so.

## 5 Finding your community

But let’s say your ethnicity or religion doesn’t entitle you to a different passport (or people block you from a passport you are entitled to). What do you do if your home state’s objectives aren’t aligned with your personal goals and ambitions and actively works against you from attempting them? I’ll assume here that you don’t have the privilege of a US passport as that would allow you to move from state to state in the US. The first step is to find your community online and then work out where they are geographically located. Whoever you are, whether you are Theodor Herzl or David Goggins you need to find people who share similar interests, are better than you at certain skills and will test your ideas. Although ultimately Herzl and Goggins settled into a more lonely experience pursuing their goals the road to success was littered with interactions with individuals who were smarter, more able, more informed and more effective at the time of those interactions. It is self defeating trying to achieve a goal in a vacuum when there are people who are better than you already working on similar goals. Get to know who those people are first. Until you understand your community, understand what it is missing and start to get frustrated by their standards or lack of their ambition it is too early to cut yourself off. 

The world is a big place and although escape routes are being closed off all the time there are still expat communities in places like Central and South America and Asia which have relaxed entry and visa requirements, are relatively cheap to live in and have good internet access. Your community probably already has a presence in some of these places but even if it doesn’t it is only a matter of time before your community starts to gravitate to places where they can meet and collaborate in person. Be the first and encourage other members of your community to join you.

## 6 Meritocracy versus “diversity”

At least in the West in 2024 “diversity” has triumphed over meritocracy. “Diversity” has been twisted into a painting by numbers “Let’s have one black girl, one brown homosexual, one Asian transexual”. That is not meritocracy and it isn’t even getting the fruits of diversity. A meritocracy measures the output and attempts to maximize that output. A healthy diverse meritocracy doesn’t care about superficialities like color of skin, gender or sexuality. It is chasing ambitious goals that needs the smartest and the hardest working and it can’t afford to make compromises to meet the painting by numbers requirements. The ticket to the game is competence, ambition and aspiration to continuously improve. If someone has a ticket to the game then different perspectives can be a net positive especially if it is challenging and testing each other’s viewpoints. But it is the output that matters. The obsession with superficial inputs is driving the West into the ground. As always it is hard to tell what is driving the “diversity” movement in the West. Is it incompetent or malicious forces within the state? Is it external forces from outside the state that are determined to cause the West’s demise? I don’t know. But if you are in an environment which cares more about the color of your skin, gender and sexuality over your potential and your work ethic you need to escape from that environment as quickly as possible. We often see our organisation or our country as the entire world but it is only a tiny part. When you start to see things that set your personal alarms off you really need to ask yourself “Am I ok with this? Does this align with the principles I want to live my life by? Can I thrive in this environment?” Because if the answer is no you need to get out of there yesterday.

Israel is not a perfect place, no such place exists. But somehow despite it feeling like a country in the collective West it is managing to not succumb to the “diversity” narrative rotting away at the West’s previous exceptionalism. Yet on actual diversity metrics it seems to be performing exceptionally well. It had one of the earliest female Prime Ministers (1969-1974) in Golda Meir predating the UK’s Margaret Thatcher by a decade. Both genders are expected to complete military service before their university studies and serve their country when required. Despite having the Jewish religion as a centerpiece for the state there are parts of Israel such as Tel Aviv which are typically atheist or agnostic where Gay Pride Week is celebrated. It also maintains an Arab population of approximately 20 percent despite being accused of seeking religious and ethnic purity by its detractors. On actual diversity metrics it is certainly a shining light in the Middle East and one could argue in the collective West as well despite the West’s obsession with “diversity”. How has it managed this? I believe it is because the Israeli state has a purpose and can’t afford to allow the meritocracy to decay. It has military threats on its borders and sometimes within its borders. Without access to natural resources or a historic role in global trade or finance it has to capitalize on new opportunities, new technologies and the new frontier that has opened up in the world of bits. Necessity is the mother of invention and a bulwark against the rot setting in in the West. Do I think the West and specifically the US is a lost cause on the road to inevitable decline? No. But the further it falls away from the example being set in Israel and the longer it goes without a severe course correction the more inevitable that decline becomes. I have been flabbergasted by Western leaders lecturing Israel on military matters as they preside over their own country sliding into decay, incompetence and increasing irrelevance. The saying "Clean your home first before complaining about others" comes to mind.

What I suspect has also happened is the world has bifurcated into the global majority penned in by nation state boundaries and the global super rich who consider the nation state, passports, patriotism, taxes and public services as cute anachronisms from a bygone era. They are still utilized as tools to keep the global majority in their pens but they impose zero constraints or assumed responsibilities on the super rich. The more dysfunctional you can make the management of those pens the more noise there is to distract the global majority from the realization that they are second class citizens and the laws that apply to them don’t apply to the global super rich. Under this hypothesis narratives like “diversity”, the normalisation of gender transition and climate change where the global majority are told to worry about cows farting as the super rich’s private planes fly over that cow start to make sense. The super rich aren’t stupid enough to actually believe these narratives but they are used to spread discord in the pens and prevent sane, smart people from arriving at the truth. Political leaders are more than happy to do the super rich’s bidding because it either provides them entertainment or an ego boost if they are already part of the super rich and if they aren’t it offers them a route to make it there when no such other route exists. As a nation state Israel is not immune to these forces but it is well placed to suffer the least. If there is a nation state that the super rich care about (or specifically the subset of the super rich that is religious Jewish) it is Israel. It is part of the Jewish identity being the only Jewish state and although Christians or Muslims may have an affinity to a particular nation state there are a large number to choose from. If one descends into poverty and chaos they can just spend more time in a different one.

This hints at the specific moral challenge I and presumably others not born into the super rich have or will have. If you have grown up in a nation state and bought into values that the super rich don’t hold what do you do? Do you shed them and do everything in your power to escape from your pen perhaps finding some way to cling onto the super rich if that is the only escape route? Or do you hold onto those values knowing this risks being trapped inside and being subject to increasing levels of chaos and poverty? Both seem unsatisfactory to me and hence a dual strategy seems the only way forward. You have to hedge the fact that the super rich could decide to make the nation state you grew up in temporarily or permanently unliveable. You can’t afford to have all your chips on a dysfunctional political system that may never reverse the decline. You must have an alternative that will allow you to continue to grow, improve and sharpen your skills even as your nation state languishes. But at the same time your ancestors fought and risked their lives for their country and what it stood for in the past. They believed in a national project, they built the infrastructure, they grew the economy to one of the strongest economies in the world. Are you ready to write off that effort in the pursuit of freedom from the pen?

I subscribe to the Jordan Peterson “make your bed first” or get your life in order first before you worry about other people’s lives: living or dead. If you can’t succeed within a system because of an incompetent and/or malicious state then you have to leave. If you succeed elsewhere you can always come back later from a position of a strength with funds to deploy rather than as a helpless, powerless and moneyless victim. But if it is a battle between a well meaning individual with a single vote at the ballot box and an overly expanded state led by puppets installed by the global super rich there is only going to be one winner.

## 7 Politics, spin and the “progression” from Sir Humphrey to Malcolm Tucker

I hate politics. As the former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said "Politics divides, science unites". Generally politics is a grubby pursuit of power filled with people who couldn't have succeeded with their limited skillsets in the marketplace. There are occasional political leaders who enter the dirty game with principles, stick to them under unbearable pressure from every possible side, both internally and externally, and manage to pull their country out of decline or set it on a course that wouldn’t have been possible without that individual’s efforts. In the UK the obvious examples from the last century are Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. One led their country to victory in World War 2 leaning heavily on the US and the other inherited a basket case of an economy with widespread strikes, a three day working week, recession and high inflation and managed to turn it around. However they are the exception rather than the rule. Certainly since Thatcher resigned in 1990 and for the three decades since civil servants such as Sir Humphrey (characterised in the UK TV show Yes, Minister) and spin doctors such as Malcolm Tucker (characterised in the UK TV show The Thick of It) have been in the ascendancy. Whether it is civil servants preventing elected politicians from implementing the policies they were elected on or spin doctors obsessively focusing on image and PR at the expense of all else the principles and resilience Churchill and Thatcher demonstrated became yet another quaint anachronism from a bygone era. David Cameron (UK Prime Minister, 2010-2016) was essentially a trained spin doctor himself. You have to look internationally for more recent examples of political leaders who made a Churchill or Thatcher level impact on their countries. An impact where you can confidently say if you switched them out for someone else history would have been very different. The obvious example is the current Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Although I’m much less familiar with Asian politics Lee Kuan Yew seems to have been long term transformative for Singapore. Then you’ve got President Trump and the El Salvador President Nayib Bukele who show promise to be elevated to this level but are definitely in the job half finished category in 2024. As the UK dishes out titles, lordships and decorations to mediocre, meaningless British leaders here in the UK you have to scour the world to find the people who have actually picked their country up and transformed it through their own individual will and a competent background staff. 

So let’s say you want to be your country’s Netanyahu or Thatcher. You don’t want to be just another name on a long list of people who managed to climb to the top of the greasy pole. You want to be able to point to where your country was when you came into power and show how your insights, your intelligence, your foresight, your resilience and your unwavering principles took it to a place that no other living human in your country could have done. Where do you start? Well first of all the vast majority of people aren’t capable. Just like sport where Roger Federer, Tiger Woods, Usain Bolt, Serena Williams etc are genetic freaks of nature I think the vast majority of people aren’t capable of being Netanyahu or Thatcher. I’m less familiar with Thatcher’s life story and what made her into the “lady not for turning”, a lady capable of crawling out of an IRA bombing of a Brighton hotel and continuing on exactly the same course. As a rare female example on this short list I think she was what David Goggins would call “an uncommon amongst the uncommon”. Most parents would not want to put their sons through the crucible that Thatcher went through let alone their daughters and that makes her even more of a freak. But because I’ve read more on Netanyahu in recent years let’s focus on him.

## 8 Israel’s most challenging century - its first

A human or any animal’s most vulnerable moments are in the early years. They don’t have the knowledge, experience or ability to fend for themselves. They don’t know the threats they should worry about, the supposed threats they don’t need to worry about and even if they did they don’t know how to effectively protect themselves from them. Certainly in the animal world it is these early years where they are most likely to fall from a tree or be torn apart by a predator. The dependence on the parents is maximized and it gradually loosens over time. Israel as a nation state didn’t really have parents. You could argue the UK was a parent controlling the land pre the formation of the Israeli nation state and issuing the Balfour declaration in 1917. In its early years as a nation state Israel obtained most of its military and financial support from France with the US initially disinterested but over the decades Israel came to rely on the US as the primary provider of military and financial support. Today you’d probably say the US is in the parental role with perhaps the UK and France in a grandparent role. But in the early years presumably the US thought it wasn’t going to survive and it wasn’t worth investing in. Nonetheless the Israeli nation state was born into a sliver of land surrounded by predators: Arab, Muslim majority countries that didn’t want it to exist and were determined to destroy the concept of a Jewish nation state in the Middle East before it gained any legitimacy. Although Herzl and others had worked on the vision in the previous decades the vision meant nothing if it was going to be destroyed by predators post conception. Hence the country Netanyahu was born into was a country housing a people still devastated by the Holocaust, with no clear parental protectors and threats wherever the eye could see. The number one priority was and even today still is defense. Put Netanyahu in a room with an Eton educated, trained spin doctor with no military experience like Cameron and he inevitably seems cold, stubborn, unreasonable and unrelenting. One has dedicated their life to the sole purpose of ensuring a viable long term future for their nation state and the other has spent their life thinking how they can change the public perception, not the stone cold reality, of a political party in peacetime. If I was Netanyahu I'd be staggered by the arrogance that a Cameron had anything to contribute to long term Israeli military strategy discussions but I digress.

The narrative during Netanyahu’s lifetime, even from many US Presidents in the supposedly parental role, is that Israel should agree to split its sliver of land in the Middle East and its capital city in half and allocate it to a nation state for Arab Muslims in a region of the world where there is nothing other than nation states for Arab Muslims. Indeed within Israel itself 20 percent of the population is Arab, presumably majority Muslim. What they’ve asked Netanyahu to do is effectively split the equivalent of London or Washington DC into two halves: one half in which they control and another half in which the historic predators control. Please note I am not accusing all Arab Muslims of being predators. Many of them live peacefully within Israeli borders and don’t present a terrorism risk. But the prospect of asking the UK or US government to do that for their capital cities is beyond absurd. So Netanyahu has spent his whole life in this dance with the parental figure who just won’t let go of this “solution” that will achieve nothing other than ensuring Israel never emerges from the waves of terrorism and internal violence in the periods it isn’t additionally fighting predators outside of its borders. So want to be your country’s Netanyahu? Try standing up for your nation state’s long term viability against the world’s greatest military power without being toppled by the CIA and without offending them to the extent that they withdraw military and financial support. That’ll test whether you are truly “not for turning”.

Let’s turn to the economy. Because unless you are going to be funded perpetually by the parental figure you have to find a way to fund your nation state’s defense yourself. Especially if you aren’t going to compromise on the long term viability of your nation state amongst disagreements with that same parental figure. In the 1980s Israel experienced hyperinflation with the inflation rate reaching as high as 450 percent. Although socialism had succeeded in building a base layer infrastructure for this still nascent nation state as many other nation states have found to their cost socialist, centrally managed economies don’t scale. Control of industries has to be wrestled from the state and exposed to competition and market forces. A now thirty something Netanyahu was surveying a nation state not much older than him with a basket case economy and what seemed like total economic dependence on the parental figure. All while dealing with the death of his brother attempting to save Israeli hostages from Entebbe in Uganda years previous. So how are you doing aspiring Netanyahu? Able to move on after the death of your brother? Still have hope for your nation state as its economy languishes in the dustbin? After years of military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with expertise in defense rather than economic matters feel up to the challenge of turning around your nation state’s economy?

The playbook for turning a socialist, state controlled economy into a capitalist market based economy is not rocket science at least today in 2024. It has happened so many times now in economies all over the world that at least the broad strokes are just following the same weathered recipe. Indeed the economic reforms carried out in the 1980s in the UK by Thatcher and Nigel Lawson had a number of parallels with the reforms implemented by Shimon Peres and Netanyahu in Israel. Identify inefficient bureaucratic state monopolies, break them apart and allow the resulting businesses to compete for customers and engage in price competition. Of course it is hideously difficult to do in practice because yet again you find yourself surrounded by swarms of predators who are determined to prevent it from happening. Whether it is bureaucrats heading up those state monopolies, criminals who are profiting from the state monopolies’ excesses, misguided left wing politicians who are convinced socialism will eventually work, the media screaming that you will destroy what's left of the economy or employees who are frightened by the prospect of having to retrain and find a new role, the battle to force through obvious reforms is intense. Your life may not be at risk in the same way it is in military operations but it certainly requires similar levels of determination and refusal to quit or compromise. What I find incredible about Peres and Netanyahu is that not only did they succeed in this socialism to capitalism transformation but they also foresaw the technological trends that would present Israel with its best opportunity to fund its defense and gradually wean itself of its dependence on the US. Peres foresaw the “computer tak(ing) the place of the sword” even if the world of atoms can never be entirely ignored and Netanyahu returned from his studies at MIT in the 1970s convinced that Israel needed its own version of Silicon Valley with military intelligence, academia and business collaborating to launch “a thousand technological ships”. Liberating currency controls and freeing monetary transactions from the central bank (Bank of Israel) was one thing but foreseeing the impact computers and the internet would have in the 1970s (before I was even born) I find astonishing. As a teenager 30 years later, admittedly in a country with a dearth of technological ambition and a brain drain to the US, it wasn’t at all clear to me that technology or software would "eat the world" in the way it has.

Warren Buffett has talked about the “ovarian lottery” which decides your race, gender, wealth, genetic intelligence, health, geography etc at birth. If you wanted to succeed in the technological boom of the 2000s and 2010s you really needed access to the US and Silicon Valley. It is almost certain in my eyes that we would have never heard of Peter Thiel, Elon Musk or Sergey Brin if they hadn’t managed to emigrate to the US. But if you couldn’t make it to the US during these decades Israel would have been your next best bet. Although it doesn’t boast the same household names, brands or company valuations as Silicon Valley the foresight of Peres and Netanyahu laid the groundwork for the “Startup Nation” and the most tech startups and largest venture capital industry per capita on the planet. Mobileye, Check Point, Monday, Wix are all Israeli technology companies worth billions of dollars today and that doesn’t include all the acquisition successes such as Waze, Chromatis and NDS also valued in the billions of dollars. For an economy collapsing under hyperinflation in the 1980s it is quite the achievement that people were writing books on how other countries should be copying Israel 30 years later. Not bad for a guy discharged from the military after being shot in the shoulder and still grieving his deceased brother.

## 9 Enter Bitcoin

I got more and more interested in Bitcoin around 2014. At that point one Bitcoin was worth approximately $200. As I write this in 2024 one Bitcoin is worth over $50,000. It has gone up by a multiple of 250. So I and many other UK citizens are now very wealthy and there is a thriving UK industry built around this new asset class valued approximately a trillion dollars? No. Well there must be a real momentum to correct that in 2024? Isn’t London supposed to be up there with New York as one of the world’s pre-eminent financial centers? Also no. What instead has happened in that decade is the UK media has covered it almost exclusively as a Ponzi scheme, a bubble, something that only criminals and money launderers ars interested in in a negative media blitz that is only comparable to its coverage of Israel during my lifetime. The UK regulator has done everything in its power to squash Bitcoin startups and Bitcoin business models including recently requiring Bitcoin exchanges to refuse to provide services to individuals who had purchased too much Bitcoin in the past and weren’t classed as high net worth individuals. The UK government has declared its intention to make the UK a “global crypto asset technology hub” all while UK banks increasingly prevent their customers from using their own funds to purchase Bitcoin. Yet another example of gaslighting from the UK state where they declare something in public whilst trying to achieve the polar opposite in private. And not only that. But during the previous decade due to the lasting effects of the 2008 financial crash, the inability to grow the UK economy and more recently the years of Covid lockdowns the Bank of England (the UK central bank with convenient regulatory powers too) has engaged in large scale money printing (“quantitative easing”) pumping up the prices of conventional asset classes, reducing the real value of cash, forcing companies into shrinking their products (“shrinkflation”) to disguise the effects of the increase in the money supply and then last year the dam burst and even official consumer price inflation rocketed. The average house price in the UK has doubled from 2009 to 2024 (statista.com) and in some cities like London that multiple was greater than 2. Unless you've managed to get a 100 percent investment return in that time you have become poorer indexed by a (real) asset that follows the monetary supply like property. If your wages have doubled in that time you are still being paid the same salary you were in 2009 in real terms adjusted by the property index. No mainstream media channel will tell you this. Why? Because the state doesn't want you to know and the media is effectively a state media. In contrast Bitcoin has a fixed monetary supply, still has large price upside and has now survived and become more and more valuable for 16 years. This is what convinces me that the UK state wants its citizens to remain poor and if anything continue to get poorer. Imagine working hard your entire life and paying your taxes to a sprawling state that doesn’t want you to succeed, doesn’t want you to become wealthy and will actively work to keep you poor. Is that what UK citizens’ ancestors fought for in World War 1 and World War 2? To be lied to, misinformed, gaslighted and ultimately prevented from becoming wealthier by the very entity their ancestors fought for and risked their lives for decades previous? It is hideous and those ancestors must be turning in their graves.

Now Bitcoin could fail. There is a history of national currencies experiencing hyperinflation, cutting some zeros off and starting again. Indeed Israel today is using the “new Shekel” rather than the “old Shekel” for this very reason. In currency or asset terms Bitcoin is that parentless baby surrounded by predators wherever the eye can see. There are a number of questions long term about what function Bitcoin will perform globally. Will it be a new global monetary unit of account, can it scale so that it can be used as a daily medium of exchange or is it digital gold for a new gold standard? Will the 21st century central bank issue national currency linked to the Bitcoin it holds in the same way as the 19th century central bank issued currency linked to the gold it holds? Or will the central banks just cut the zeros off their national currency and all the people whose savings were inflated away over previous decades forgive and forget? I don’t know. But what I do know is over the previous decade all branches of the UK state have done everything in their power to suppress Bitcoin, suffocate Bitcoin startups at birth and brainwash its citizens to associate it with crime and fraud. Just as the UK media has portrayed Israel as a nation state with no redeeming features other than terrorism and military responses the media has put the fraudsters, the Ponzi schemes that latch onto Bitcoin and the venture capitalists promoting alternatives to Bitcoin whilst privately buying Bitcoin themselves on the pedestal and broadcasting their messages out far and wide. Nothing on the potential merits of Bitcoin, nothing on its fixed monetary supply versus the seemingly unlimited quantitative easing (printing money) the central banks are carrying out in the shadows and nothing on some of the smartest developers and technologists globally being attracted to Bitcoin as arguably their generation’s greatest opportunity to make the historic impact and the wealth that the previous wave of internet entrepreneurs (Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin etc) made. Peter Thiel's and Elon Musk's PayPal initially set out to build a global digital currency and ultimately failed. Bitcoin could "fail" too, it could fade into irrelevance just as people were writing off the internet at the turn of the millennia. But for the UK state to prevent their citizens from making that choice to participate in it, to prevent their citizens from potentially making money from it and to try to prevent digital Bitcoin from moving between citizens in the same way as laptops obtain search query bits from Google is the height of arrogance and sinister incompetence. UK citizens are not free, the UK state knows what’s best for you and all those times in the past the UK state lied to you or was wrong about important issues? Well you can’t remember them goldfish brain can you? Here’s what Meghan and Harry are up to today.

## 10 The method behind the madness - how to make a country great again

When a country has sunk into the abyss for decades, every branch of the state seems to be compromised by forces that solely want to keep the majority in their pens and everyone seems to be indifferent to their fate is it over? Do you write that country off as a failed project? Is it impossible to turn it around? Well probabilistically nothing is impossible but if you compare the challenge to say the challenge Trump has faced in making America great again, the UK has been and still is in much worse shape. It wasn’t too long ago that Wall Street, Washington DC, Silicon Valley, Hollywood etc were the envy of the world. What exactly has the world been envious of in the UK in recent decades? This is not to denigrate the challenge that Trump faced and still faces in 2024 but for the UK to attempt something similar you’d need a Trump on steroids. Someone who could pick up the Trump playbook and somehow take it to even further extremes. So I guess the first step is to understand the Trump playbook. Friedrich Nietzsche, the 19th century German philosopher stated “All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity”. The first phase of Trump’s reincarnation as a political leader back in 2015 rather than a business mogul and TV personality was to shock and seize attention of the airwaves. This was a step change from the personality he displayed previously. In his many TV appearances over the decades he is passionate, driven and certainly a committed capitalist but he is greeted warmly by TV hosts and TV audiences on all sides of the political spectrum. In 2015 that changed. Whether it be Mexican immigrants are “bringing crime, they’re rapists and some I assume are good people”, TV networks that he’d previously regularly appeared on were an “enemy of the people” or “I think Islam hates us” he deliberately courted controversy with messaging which dressed up his legitimate concerns on immigration, the TV networks being dragged leftwards under Obama and the continued terrorism threat from Islamist extremists into soundbites designed to shock. This was very different to the typical politician. Firstly the typical politician doesn’t seem to have any principles or deeply held beliefs, they will say what they need to say to get elected and to keep their donors happy. But secondly they will also communicate in a way designed to upset as few potential voters as possible so as not to harm their election prospects. Trump wasn’t getting into politics to add his name to the list of US Presidents. He was getting into politics to make America great again after a lifetime of frustration with the American political system. This all cumulated obviously in January 6th where Trump was willing to go right up to the line with his justified anger over censorship and lack of controls around widespread postal voting but critically without crossing it. In a nation with the world’s strongest military and intelligence agencies such as the CIA and NSA and after four years of being embroiled in impeachments and investigations from everything to Russia collusion to financial fraud to sex scandals crossing that line could have been fatal. A UK based Trump would probably have been put in jail for hate speech years previous for “I think Islam hates us”.

## 11 The first term - dismantling the state

Imagine you are an Allied soldier liberating prisoners from a Nazi concentration camp or an Israeli soldier attempting to free an Israeli hostage from an underground network of tunnels in Gaza. You are surveying a complex structure that was built for a purpose: in the former to exterminate the Jews and in the latter to undermine and ultimately destroy the nation state of Israel. If you don’t have the same goals as those who built those structures in the first place you have to effectively decide whether you can repurpose those structures for a different goal and if not destroy them to make space for something new. The first term of the Trump Presidency was utterly bewildering. You had individuals who had no qualifications and no business being near the machinery of government being hired and fired within weeks and sometimes days. What was the “stable genius” doing? Well if you are going to do some destroying you are going to need to engage in some distraction tactics. The left in America has produced some incredible inspiring and eloquent speakers from John F Kennedy to Barack Obama but you’d struggle to outline their political achievements in office and you’d also struggle to argue that they really changed the trajectory of their country. The focus was on words rather than actions. Meanwhile to the intellectual, ivory tower classes Trump, Bush Jr and maybe even Reagan seem like idiots. The media and political circus never stops and so if you are actually going to succeed in taking a sledge hammer to complex structures that aren’t required anymore and perhaps never were you need them focused in the opposite direction being driven into a frenzy because a supposed moron was elected President or there is a revolving door of crazy White House appointments. The media relations with the JFKs and the Obamas were a love-in. Meanwhile the media generally demonizes those on the right and so you need someone or something to absorb that hate. If Trump is reelected in 2024 the focus will almost certainly be on the rebuilding of America now that some of those complex structures have been destroyed or at least been shown up to be acting in the opposite interests of its people. No doubt Trump will still seek to shock occasionally but the first phase is complete. The next phase post demolition is to rebuild.

## 12 The supposedly perfectly neutral paragon of virtue that is the BBC

If you watch television in the UK you are forced to pay the TV license fee under the threat of fines and ultimately jail. It doesn’t matter if you never watch anything on the BBC and watch other channels exclusively you still must pay the TV license fee. The license fee goes predominantly to the BBC. This puts the BBC in an incredibly powerful position. Firstly it is “free” to view in the same way as other state services are supposedly “free”. They’re obviously not free, they are taxpayer funded but in the world of socialism you pay your taxes, ignore how they’re being spent and then marvel that you’re lucky enough to live in a country that dishes out free stuff. As it is “free” to view, doesn’t require optional subscription fees to be paid or ads to be viewed the less affluent gravitate towards the BBC for entertainment and more crucially news. The justification for the BBC being funded by its citizens under the threat of jail is that the BBC is politically neutral, impartial and balanced. We’ll explore some of the examples where the BBC has failed hideously in its supposed objective but G*d himself would be unable to fulfil this objective. In a world of 8 billion people and let’s say 24 hours of daily news coverage every decision to try to stay politically neutral, impartial and balanced is impossible. Let’s say there is a terrorist attack in Israel and Sierra Leone at a similar time. Which do you shine a light on by covering it? Who do you interview? What are their political biases? How much time do you spend covering it? Should you cover either at all when there are 70 million people in your home country who have their own challenges. Every minute there are crimes being committed in your home country from rape to murder to sexual abuse of minors to burglaries. You have one light and only 24 hours to shine it. What is the politically neutral, impartial and balanced way to shine it? It is an impossible question to answer.

What the BBC has settled on in recent years and in many cases much longer than that is a stance that is anti Brexit, anti Israel, anti capitalism, anti conservatism, anti religion, ignores atrocities in parts of the world that don’t matter (Africa, Asia etc), ignores scandals that occur within BBC walls such as the child sexual abuse of “Sir” Jimmy Savile (yes he was awarded a Knight Bachelor and Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire which I’m sure his victims appreciated at the time) and instead buys totally into the concern with cows farting and the “diversity” agenda. If you don’t want to fund this agenda, tough. It will be prison for you comrade. Why the supposed right wing, nominally the Conservative Party, in the UK puts up with this is a total mystery. No matter what the BBC does the government at the time, right wing or left wing, renews the Royal Charter without fail ensuring citizens can’t watch television without funding the BBC. With the power to decide what is politically neutral, impartial and balanced the BBC can essentially decide what the center ground of a spectrum is. If the center ground is anti Israel for example then it provides a space which can freely support terrorism and the attempted destruction of Israel because that is a valid “left of center” position. Anyone who is pro Israel isn’t on the center, they aren’t even on the right, they are on the supposed far right. If the BBC’s defined center ground cares more about “diversity” than child sex rings committed by predominantly Muslim immigrants in the north of England then someone who cares about those child sex rings (e.g. Tommy Robinson) isn’t on the right, they are on the supposed far right. The BBC decides where the center ground is and who should be ignored and censored as far right and who should be given a platform on a mainstream news channel despite hideous anti white, anti male, anti working class, anti Jewish and anti Israel hatred. As I write this (March 2024) the BBC has been exposed yet again for a sympathetic documentary on refugees that showcased individuals (Omar and Mohamed Badreddin) who were later found guilty of torturing and raping a 13 year old girl. Not only that but the BBC aired accusations that the 13 year old girl was racist and had made up the rape accusation. The spirit of "Sir" Jimmy Savile lives on at the BBC. Harbor and protect child abusers and if anyone complains accuse them of being "far right" and/or racist. This is the BBC's center ground. 

Isn’t the BBC regulated? If UK citizens are forced to fund it and it is able to define the center ground of political discourse in the country then surely the regulator must be all over them compared to competing news channels that aren’t in this privileged position. Well there is a regulator “Ofcom” or the “Office of Communications” which obviously is also taxpayer funded and yet another branch of the state that is essentially regulating itself in this case if you consider the BBC a different branch of the state. But instead of being all over the BBC in recent times it has instead turned most of its attention and resources on startup news channels like GB News and TalkTV. Startup news channels that aren’t taxpayer funded, don’t have powers to throw citizens in jail and have no authority to define the center ground or define the spectrum of an issue. These businesses have to find ways to fund themselves with advertising or subscriptions and viewers have to consciously seek them out being tucked away on a previously unused TV channel number, a website or a YouTube channel. So why has Ofcom prioritized cracking down on these startup news channels and given the BBC an effective free pass? We know the answer (state good, competition bad) but what is Ofcom’s justification? Well they aren’t sufficiently impartial of course! The BBC succeeds in being impartial (of course!) with occasional slip ups but these alternative news channels don’t sit neatly on the spectrum that the BBC essentially defines. Individuals who are ignored, censored or dismissed as “far right” on the BBC are sometimes given a platform on these news channels which is unacceptable. Right wing politicians who wouldn’t be given much if any time to express their views on the BBC are given ample time to express their views on these alternatives. And sometimes, and this really is horrific, they have discussions or debates between individuals who are all to the right of the center of the BBC’s spectrum. Without one individual to the left of the center of the BBC’s spectrum. No Israel haters, no individuals preaching the gospel of the scourge of cows farting or the heavenly delights of “diversity” and no child rapists. Thankfully your taxpayer UK pounds are hard at work trying to prevent these sorts of horrific things happening on a news channel you aren’t required to fund and you certainly aren’t required to watch.

## 13 The long hand of the state

The internet (and Bitcoin if it wasn’t suppressed from birth) theoretically at least presented the opportunity for individuals and communities to interact and discuss topics that haven’t been sanctioned by the BBC from the comfort of your bedroom. What these startup news channels are showing is that in a world of websites and YouTube channels a state issued channel number or license to operate isn’t required to get your content out. Companies like Facebook, Twitter (now X) and YouTube initially built incredibly good software using skilled software developers who at various points didn’t meet the “diversity” requirements of the present day. The outputs (the software or the code running on your machine) were of a very high standard and the users didn’t care if a transsexual, Chinese female who sometimes identifies as a cat contributed code to it or not. But if you thought that signalled the permanent victory of free speech and market competition over the state you’d have been mistaken. What we saw during the end of the first Trump term, the BLM riots and the Covid pandemic was the state fightback. The state managed to both internally infiltrate these companies and externally exert pressure on these companies to clamp down on individuals and topics that didn’t align with the state sanctioned spectrum of views. It cumulated in the sitting President of the United States being booted off Twitter and unable to communicate with his followers using that platform. The sitting President of the United States. In the United States. If the sitting President of the United States succumbs to these forces what hope does the Tommy Robinson or the Joe Bloggs have? The kind of rug pulling these platforms have engaged in is particularly heinous because you can spend years of your life publishing content and building a following only for your presence on that platform to be digitally assassinated because a few employees at those companies didn’t agree with your views. With in many cases zero explanation and no legal recourse. And that is if you managed to evade the digital assassination to build up a following in the first place. If these platforms spot you early enough they can just stop anyone finding your content organically through search and every view and every follow you obtain can only be through a determined pursuit on the behalf of the consumer to find that content at the expense of all alternatives. “I want X” gets a response of “Are you sure you don’t want Y”, “Ok but are you sure you don’t want Z?” until the consumer just assumes that content doesn’t exist anymore. It is the equivalent of imprisoning you in a digital dungeon. You’re still alive, you haven’t been digitally assassinated but no one can find you or communicate with you. Again with zero explanation and no legal recourse. The code for these digital assassinations or these digital dungeons isn’t published, it isn’t open source. And even if it was open source employees at the company can just override the code in the cases where a digital assassination or a new digital dungeon is required. The promise that these platforms initially showed has been quashed by the long hand of the state. Not content at ruling over the world of bits the UK state is now pursuing an Online Safety Bill to regulate online speech and media. So don’t like the “diversity” agenda and want to go back to a diverse meritocracy? Not only will you be digitally assassinated or digitally imprisoned the state will find a way to imprison you in the world of atoms. Long live the state comrade.

## 14 The Covid pandemic - the state’s wet dream

The UK state in peacetime has already got its tentacles in every aspect of your life from what you watch on the television, what your favourite online platform is able to recommend to you to watch next, what you eat, how that food is produced, the tap water you drink, what new technologies are funded and what new technologies aren’t, what crimes are investigated and what crimes are ignored and indeed what is a crime in the first place. Today if I provide an ATM in the UK so someone can buy Bitcoin with physical cash I can be arrested and fined. But it is during national emergencies when the UK state hoovers up the few remaining freedoms that UK citizens have. The Covid pandemic presented the first truly national emergency since World War 2 and we got to see what life is like when you surrender every freedom to the state. To start with the slow initial response to give the virus the chance to enter the country and spread like wildfire while other countries like the US imposed early travel restrictions from China. Then daily government briefings that you were essentially forced to watch because it would outline whether you had to wear a mask or not, whether you were allowed to leave your house and for how long, whether you were allowed to mix with anyone else outside of your household and how many people you were allowed to mix with, how far you could venture from your home and which supermarkets you could enter. As we now know this was all while the people in charge of making these decisions, reversing these decisions and then reinstating these decisions were having parties and handing out hundreds of million pound contracts to their friends to provide products they had no prior experience providing and in many cases failed to satisfy the terms of. Up to 40 billion pounds was spent on the Track and Trace app that barely worked, no one used and was eventually shelved. This continued over the course of the best part of two years. We had Rishi Sunak, later rewarded with the post of UK Prime Minister, introducing the “Eat out to help out” scheme with the government (taxpayer funded of course) paying 50 percent of people’s bills to eat out in restaurants only to soon go back into a state enforced lockdown again. No additional protections around care homes where the elderly and infirm were housed and no ability for loved ones to see them before they died. Every person was under the same restrictions even though it was clear from early on that Covid posed a much greater risk to the old and a very low risk to the young. Then we had the introduction of the Covid vaccine. The government declared it “safe and effective” when all vaccines pose risk of side effects especially new vaccines which haven’t been tested over the long term. They threatened to impose travel restrictions, work restrictions and restrictions on where you could eat and drink if you didn’t take the vaccine. We now know GCHQ, the UK’s version of the NSA, was cracking down on online discussion of the potential long terms risks of the vaccine and whether the vaccine was as effective as it was being marketed as. One day the government was stating the vaccine prevented the spread of Covid, the next day the government was stating it didn’t. What about the opposition parties? Surely they were challenging the decision making and questioning whether younger people should be locked down for two years and be forced to take the vaccine when Covid posed very little risk to them. Zero. If anything they were fighting for even longer lockdowns, even greater state imposed restrictions and more forceful threats to take the vaccine whatever the person’s circumstances. The cherry on top was the government briefings encouraging the public to have weekly clapping sessions to encourage NHS staff who were utterly failed by the incompetence of the state. It all seems like a bad dream now but it happened. And afterwards? In the spirit of regularly sweeping the state’s sinister incompetence under the rug an inquiry was set up so lawyers could be paid by the taxpayer to ultimately after many years and millions spent find no one responsible. Over 200,000 dead, the economy trashed, large swathes of small businesses bankrupt, a resumption of Bank of England quantitative easing debasing the currency to pay everyone to sit at home for 2 years and the state finances plundered to enrich cronies during a national emergency. Long live the state comrade.

If nothing changes after all that and business just continues as usual what has to happen for the public to realize that they are being taken for fools by the state they continue to fund with their taxes? Their elderly relatives being slaughtered in care homes through negligence, their younger relatives being lied to and cajoled into a taking a new vaccine multiple times when it wasn’t at all clear Covid posed a greater risk to their health than the vaccine itself. Of course the political and media circus wants to move on and avoid accountability, they want to pretend it never happened and they are relying on the public having goldfish brains or blaming it all on a single boogeyman: Putin, Brexit, Matt Hancock etc. But what more does the state have to do? Literally have government employees break into people’s homes and rape their daughters in front of them? The Covid pandemic should have resulted in an absolute overturning of UK politics. Like a plot from Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, every single branch of the state totally failed and each one has blood on their hands. Yet in 2024 the UK is going into an election with both major parties trying to make it a business as usual election. A banning of vapes here, a 1p cut in income tax rate here. Allegiance to the same political correctness and “diversity” agenda that left elderly relatives dying without being able to see loved ones for a final time. If the UK isn’t over and there is still a spark of hope that it can be turned around there has to be a major showing for new parties and individuals who previously got censored by the state and written off as racists, cranks and conspiracy theorists. Because if the state can just get away with it after all that there is nothing it can’t get away with.

## 15 The 20th century UK state’s primary objective: managed decline

After the breakup of the British Empire and two world wars where the center of global power shifted from London to Washington DC it was inevitable that there was going to be a painful reckoning as the UK adjusted to not being the focal point of power, influence and wealth generation certainly in the West and arguably of the entire planet. But did this strategy of managed decline really have to last 80 years? And if it isn’t reversed today in 2024 will it ever be reversed? There are numerous empires such as the Greek and Roman empires that seemingly never did recover and although they still maintain a proud culture and popular tourist destinations the route for smart, ambitious Greeks and Italians to succeed today is to emigrate to the US. Is it inevitable that the UK becomes yet another Greece or Italy? Or is it possible that it takes inspiration from smaller states that never had empires such as Israel and Singapore and rebuilds as a larger, technologically advanced equivalent. All countries have their reasons for complacency. Australia for example has relied on natural resources for decades to ensure a high quality of life for its citizens and so the kind of skill and expertise required to build a globally competitive technology company like Apple or Google say just hasn’t been a priority. The UK’s problem has been its reliance on its history rather than its future to stay relevant. London will always be a critical financial center right? It once was the center of the British Empire. Global companies will always need a presence in the UK because you won’t find the skills and expertise to manage a multinational company anywhere else right? As the decades wear on and the British Empire and the world wars become a long distant memory it is not at all clear that this is or will always be the case. Unless a company from Israel or Singapore wants guidance on how to meet “diversity” or net zero requirements what does London or the UK have to offer? 70 million people is a decent sized market but compared to the US (300 million) or say India (1.4 billion) or China (1.4 billion) it is still pretty small. All the different branches of the UK state would say that’s an argument for staying in the EU and remaining part of a 450 million person market. And maybe it is if managed decline is the only possible strategy for the UK. Group together with a bunch of other European nations with a similar or worse problem post empires or post attempted empires and at least there will be strength in numbers. Cobble together an unelected European Commission with no democratic mandate or accountability to the European people and it won’t really matter. No one can afford to ignore a 450 million person market right? Although of course this wasn’t spelt out during the Brexit referendum campaign this is effectively what the decision came down to. Believe the UK can do better or continue with managed decline and huddling in the EU for strength in numbers. All the branches of the UK state wanted the latter. The UK people chose the former.

A key pillar in a strategy of managed decline is suppressing ambition, patriotism, a shared sense of national identity and that pesky desire to make a country great again. Brain drain is fine, if anything it should be encouraged. You don’t want smart people questioning why certain things are being done or not being done. You don’t want them questioning if their area really is being improved when it is swamped by immigrants from third world countries. But for those that stay you don’t want them grouping together under a flag and a pride for their national history demanding better than what the state wants for them. If you can you want to splinter those attempted groupings, demonize the leaders of those groupings, censor them, throw them in jail, give them criminal records (an experience Tommy Robinson and the Britain First leader Paul Golding can both attest to) and if possible convince the entire population that the national flag that their ancestors fought and risked their lives under now represents racism and violence. Just as the Nazis encouraged the waving of the Nazi emblem rather than the German flag, in recent times UK streets are filled with people waving the Palestinian flag for a nation state that doesn’t exist rather than the UK flag. In the week that I write this (w/c February 19th 2024) “From the river to the sea”, a slogan calling for the destruction of Israel was beamed onto Big Ben next to the UK Parliament. Discussions inside the UK Parliament on the Israeli military action against the terror group Hamas were supposedly disrupted by the mounting Islamist terror threat outside. All in the same week as the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, a Muslim, was blocking plans for a statue of the late Queen Elizabeth II and instead renaming London Overground lines to promote the “diversity” agenda.

It is worth remembering that the true heroes of various causes whether it be the Suffragettes fighting for women’s rights in the UK at the beginning of the 20th century or the Martin Luther Kings of the civil rights movement in the US in the middle of the 20th century suffered exactly the same fate as Tommy Robinson and Paul Golding have in recent times. Today the state despises white, working class males. I started watching a TV dramatic series “The Undeclared War” (Channel 4, a state owned TV channel) on GCHQ and cyber attacks and couldn’t make it through a single episode because the “diversity” agenda was just being forced down viewers’ throats. They described white males as “male, pale and stale” completely ignoring whether they were competent at their job or not. The hero was the teenage Asian female work experience student with no prior cyber security experience and no understanding of the existing cyber security systems but she was somehow able to thwart a cyber attack that the useless “male, pale and stale” long term employees were unable to do. This delivers two messages that are unrelenting across all UK media and culture today. Firstly, that white males can’t be good at their job and they are only there because of the racist patriarchy. And secondly, that you don’t have to work hard over a long period of time to build up expertise in a subject matter and then apply it in a security critical setting. Instead you can just show up as a teenage student with no experience and as long as you’re not “male, pale and stale” you’ll be able to transform national security. The UK military and security services have been diverse and competent in the past. Indeed the Gurkhas say fought on the side of the Allies in World War 2. But what has changed since then is that competence and a diverse meritocracy is no longer the aim. Instead the aim is the painting by numbers “diversity” and hatred for white, working class males whatever their qualities, abilities or work ethic. Which is quite the problem given that 80 percent of the UK population is white today and the white male population totals 28 million people. That’s a lot of people that Tommy Robinson and Paul Golding are standing up for.

Of course in a population of 28 million white males there are going to be a small minority that still hold truly racist or white supremacy views though it seems to be dwindling decade by decade. Certainly in the arena of sport, one rare industry in the UK where you still have a diverse meritocracy, individuals of all races and religions are able to succeed and are idolised by white male supporters. The fact that Mohamed Salah is Muslim, Son Heung-min is Korean or Bukayo Saka is black doesn't factor in most of the time. You certainly don't have lifelong Liverpool supporters stop supporting Liverpool because their star player is a Muslim or lifelong Arsenal supporters stop supporting Arsenal because their star player is black. Yet in other industries like finance, consulting, law and certainly in the sprawling state apparatus your skill and competence is secondary to your race and gender. In those industries the Erling Haalands and the Kevin De Bruynes are looked down on for being "male, pale and stale". Instead of picking the best players available to them Man City would have dropped Haaland and De Bruyne and played a black player or a Muslim player instead. This isn't just a "diversity" agenda. This is racism. It is just that racism that would have been directed towards black people a century ago is now being directed towards white people.

What perplexes me is that in a population of 28 million there are so few Tommy Robinsons and Paul Goldings willing to resist and fight back. There is no way in a million years a white Allied soldier would have returned from fighting in World War 2 and put up with racism towards him in his own country. Or that Winston Churchill would have stood aside for an ethnic minority leader during World War 2 because he was "male, pale and stale". It is unfathomable. But every time the state takes another step towards becoming more racist and more sexist towards white males today the white males just put with it. It is yet another reason why the UK state seems to despise Israel. Although Israel has a diverse society it wouldn't sit back and allow racism towards Jews in its own country. It wouldn't allow leaders and politicians to promote an agenda that looks down on and dismisses Jews for being Jewish. What would the point be of having a Jewish nation state if Jews were second class citizens in that nation state? Yet in the UK you have a predominantly white, Christian population and they are allowing themselves to be cast as second class citizens in that nation state. The frog is being slowly boiled and it is doing nothing about it. The state is very sly. It will find the rare examples of individuals being racist towards ethnic minorities whether that be a British 12 year old boy arrested for racially abusing the black footballer Wilfried Zaha on social media or the death of a black man 4000 miles away across an ocean (George Floyd) and use those examples to drum home the message that the racism problem is still with the white working class. Yet there is only one race being openly criticised for the color of their skin in supposedly respectable forums, there is only one race being forced out of organizations or denied promotions because of the color of their skin and there is only one race being mocked on state owned television channels for the color of their skin. And that race is not black or Asian people. That race is white British people.

## 16 Now or never: the fightback

Today the numbers are on the white working classes' side. In a population of 67 million white British people make up the majority (80 percent). In a supposedly democratic system where it is one person, one vote that should be a large enough voting bloc to ensure the white working classes don't permanently become second class citizens in their own country. But the UK state is not on their side and that is the most powerful entity of all. We've already discussed the BBC and the media's ability to define the spectrum of an issue. On immigration (both legal and illegal) the "acceptable" center ground position in recent decades has been that arguing against mass immigration from third world countries is racist or far right. With that spectrum in place legal (we'll ignore illegal for now) net migration statistics have boomed. 750,000 net inwards migration in the year to December 2022 with similar figures in 2023. Where these people are coming from, what they potentially offer the country, whether they are the next Peter Thiel or the next Osama Bin Laden isn't discussed. Again in a football analogy it would be the equivalent of not caring whether you are signing Mohamed Salah or Osama Bin Laden. A Muslim star that lights up a cup final at the old twin towers of Wembley Stadium or a terrorist that lights up the Twin Towers of New York and brings a country to its knees by slaughtering thousands of innnocent civilians. The state seemingly doesn't care. But what it does seem to care about is eroding that white working class voting bloc. The area in which I grew up as a kid, Wembley in North London, barely has any white British people in it anymore. It is not even that white British people are the minority. When I get on a bus to Wembley I am nearly always the only white British person on the bus by the time I reach my destination and even I'm half Jewish. The entire bus is of a different race, speaking a different language and seemingly with greater allegiance and fondness to the country they came from than the country they're living in. In thirty years it has gone from a typical British working class area to what seems like a suburban slum of Mumbai. Other parts of London or other UK cities now seem like a suburban slum of Kabul or Islamabad. Did anyone vote for this? Did the Conservative or Labour government ever say "Vote for us. We'll turn your city into Kabul or Islamabad?". No. They threw the racism accusation at anyone who even broached the subject of "Is this government doing what we want? Is it in my interests if my hometown becomes Kabul or Islamabad? If I don't want this who am I supposed to vote for? And why are those options being derided in the mainstream media as racist or languishing in prison?". The sight of London and other UK cities being swarmed by Palestinian flags rather than UK flags has been a long time in the making. And who has their fingerprints all over it? You guessed it, the UK state.

When surveying the UK state apparatus today in 2024 you really are that Allied solider surveying that Nazi concentration camp or that Israeli soldier surveying the Gaza network of tunnels for the first time. What exactly is worth salvaging here? Don't get me wrong, when the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in the UK in 1948 I'm sure the founders never envisaged politicians enriching themselves as nurses struggled to save lives and loved ones perished alone in care homes. I'm sure when GCHQ was founded in 1919 the founders never envisaged it being used to suppress discussion of vaccine efficacy and safety and instead priortizing "diversity" over national security. I'm sure when the BBC was founded in 1922 the founders never envisaged repeated cover ups of scandals like "Sir" Jimmy Savile's child abuse or sympathizing with Hamas terrorists in Gaza. I'm sure when the Bank of England was founded in 1694 the founders never envisaged money printing on the scale the Bank of England has engaged in the last decade all whilst lying about it and trying to hide the scale of it from its citizens. But in 2024 we are where we are, you can't keep your head in the sand. These branches of the state, no doubt set up with the best intentions by well meaning, patriotic people are today rotting from the inside. On a case by case basis there may be things to salvage from these rotting corpses. But the people who should be making those evaluations are the people who identified these problems and were brave and courageous enough to attempt to prevent them from happening. There aren't many of these people. There are the Tommy Robinsons and Paul Goldings who were willing to go to prison to stand up for the white working classes. There are some politicians like Nigel Farage who fought for Brexit for many years and were derided for believing Britain could do better than cowering in an undemocratic European Union. There are politicians like Andrew Bridgen who today is determined to get to the truth on what we injected into our bodies during the Covid pandemic and what was motivating the threats from the state to ensure every person took the vaccine regardless of personal health considerations. These people do exist. But today they are on the edges of power and the state directed discourse. If the fightback is going to happen this needs to flip. The spineless state stooges need to be removed and the enemies of the state need to come in and survey the damage. Otherwise the white working classes will be waking up in 2050 and they will be the minority at the ballot box in their own country. 

## 17 Controlled opposition: the state's Uncle Toms

I think it is inevitable the pendulum swings back from the extreme left wing and socialist ideologies that peaked during the Covid pandemic of 2020-2022. But the pendulum gently swinging back and resting at a less extreme center left position won't cut it for the UK after 80 years of managed decline. As I said earlier if there is any hope for the UK it needs a Trump on steroids. Not only is this individual going to be demonized, censored and suppressed by all branches of the UK state they are also going to suffer the same treatment from state adjacent media and Big Tech platforms which will do whatever the state tells them to do knowing that the state has the power to rug pull their business. A lot has been made of Elon Musk's 44 billion dollar acquistion of Twitter and rebranding to X.com in 2022 and alhough this is a step in the right direction (you can't really get worse than preventing a sitting US President from communicating with the US electorate) it is clear that the days of untrammelled free speech and finding individuals with perhaps niche shared interests is long gone. Even post Musk induced changes there are topics that when discussed will ensure your account gets suppressed such that no one sees your content and although some code has been published on the logic behind the digital dungeons (again a step in the right direction) X.com still maintains a private list of blacklisted topics and processes for digital assassinations that seem totally dependent on Musk's biases, moods and state strongarming (AlexFinnX, February 27th 2024). This Trump on steroids is going up against the most powerful Goliath in human history. Never before has a population been captive to Big Tech platforms with the illusion of free speech and digital freedom of movement but with the reality of state directed discourse. In the UK GB News and TalkTV are also a step in the right direction in the media landscape but the content is often sterilized and following the same talking points of the other mainstream news channels. Neither will give a platform to the Tommy Robinsons or Paul Goldings of the country and they generally just sweep up the unwanted TV personalities like Piers Morgan who have left the mainstream channels. New voices and new individuals who aren't tarnished by association with the scandal and mediocrity of the previous decades aren't really breaking through or given a platform. The strategy to fight the Goliath hence has to be incredibly nuanced and targeted. Building up a grassroots following in the world of atoms now that Covid based restrictions on the freedom of movement have been relaxed is going to be a critical part. Books and promotional materials can be purchased in the world of bits from independent websites when Amazon and Big Tech platforms refuses to sell them. Payments, donations and general fundraising can be done through Bitcoin and QR codes when the banks refuse an individual or an organization access to bank account. It is not going to be easy, far from it. But when all you have is a metaphorical sling and stones you have to make do with what you've got.

## 18 Your ticket to the game

In a diverse meritocracy, which the UK clearly isn't in 2024, the only way to get a ticket to the game and not be a NPC (non-player character) is to hone a particular skill or build expertise in a science or technology. The upper classes can afford to study exclusively humanities and the arts and not scrutinize their views to data or test their abilities in the marketplace but the working classes do not have this luxury. If they are to escape from minimum wage jobs and/or pointless jobs that were only introduced to keep them occupied the working classes have to be able to clearly demonstrate their value. The "diversity" agenda suppresses the white working class majority but it hurts the ethnic minority working classes too if they care about testing the limits of their potential like David Goggins has done pushing his body to the brink and meticulously studying his mind during that process. The message from the upper classes to the ethnic minority working classes in the UK is "You are a victim in this racist society. There's a role for you in our painting by numbers hiring process even if you aren't skilled in anything." This is not to say writing isn't an important adjacent skill whether that be completing an application form or writing a convincing proposal. But without that skill or expertise you have nothing of merit to write about. The upper classes will tell the ethnic minority working classes "Your emotions as a victim have value. This evil white person will never know what it feels like to be a black person and so you can always lecture them about your emotions or feelings in any given day." But every single human has emotions or feelings in a given day. And if you are desperate to find something that gives them merit in a victimhood mentality you will find it. Maybe you're fat, maybe the opposite sex was mean to you once, maybe you're unattractive, maybe your parents were neglectful, maybe you were bullied once at school or in the workplace. Every single person will have reasons for a victim mentality. Whether the upper classes see those reasons as valid enough to carve out a path in a hiring process for those reasons is a different question but in a diverse meritocracy it shouldn't matter. The upper classes shouldn't even be in that position to make those decisions unless they have also demonstrated excellence in a particular skill or expertise.

There are still plenty of opportunies in the world of atoms for truly skilled or experienced practitioners but at least in the UK the opportunities in the world of bits are severely underestimated and misunderstood. No one from the upper classes to the working classes seems to have a handle on just how much the world of bits has embedded in our lives today such that even in the world of atoms you are using the world of bits as an interface to navigate the world of atoms. I suspect this is due to a number of reasons. Firstly, those who have built multibillion dollar companies in the world of bits, predominantly in Silicon Valley in recent decades, don't generally come to countries like the UK encouraging its citizens to build their expertise. They are looking for captive users to increase their bottom lines or to misdirect to leave the path clear for their own companies' success. They aren't looking for skilled upstarts trying to get a foothold in their industry. This is why you see fawning discussions between say the current UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk (November 2023) on the threats of artificial general intelligence (AGI) all while Elon Musk has a company (Neuralink) inserting chips into people's brains. If you are truly worried about AGI destroying humanity it probably isn't a great idea to give that AGI access to directly manipulate humans' brains. But this kind of discussion perfectly encapsulates the meeting of minds when the useless British upper classes meet a canny operator from Silicon Valley seeking to misdirect. Anyone with deep expertise in a scientific or technical topic will know ChatGPT spouts utter nonsense once you test its limits and poses as much danger to humanity as a single human with an IQ of 80 and without a physical body to move around in. Yet you'd have no idea of this if you listened to UK politicians and the UK media.

## 19 Going through the ethical turnstile

Once you've honed a particular skill or built a deep expertise in a science or technology you've obtained your ticket to the game. It is difficult, it takes a long time and certainly requires more effort than declaring "I'm black, have emotions and hence should be hired to discuss those emotions". With that ticket you now enter the ethical turnstile. The first decision is where you apply your skillset. The hardest, most impactful and ultimately most financially rewarding route is to build something new from nothing. A society that cares about generating tax revenues to pay for national defense and public services (seemingly not the UK in 2024) should be encouraging the smartest and most able to pursue this route especially when the world of bits is dominated by American giants paying next to zero tax in the UK. It is the most stressful, requires round the clock focus, can't afford to succumb to the "diversity" agenda and presents a high probability of ultimate failure but within a large corporation it is next to impossible to generate millions, hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars from nothing. And if you want that large corporation to pay a reasonable rate of tax on the wealth you generate for them it is literally impossible. It may well be that without understanding a particular industry or the nature of real world problems that need solving a new graduate would be better placed learning about them within a large corporation or organization for the first few years. But the ultimate goal for the smartest and most able in a healthy society must be to create wealth from nothing. Anything less is the Mohamed Salahs and Bukayo Sakas of an industry settling with playing in the second or third tier of English football. For IT graduates or skilled software developers in 2024, the Big Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Meta are just so huge that finetuning a tiny cog at the edge of their infrastructure probably isn't good preparation for trying to build a new business from scratch a few years down the line. But want to build a technology company in health, finance, law, education, defense etc? Go work in that industry and work out where the opportunities are. Most of them are floundering in the world of bits and so the opportunities are endless. Assuming you experience some success, pick a problem that people really want solving, obtain funding, users and ultimately revenues the next ethical turnstile you go through is whether to cash in and sell to a large corporation. Almost without fail large corporations seem to acquire startups to destroy them. They present a threat to their lumbering business, they embarrass them showing what small groups of people are capable of and they catch large corporation's shareholders eyes wondering why these problems aren't getting solved within the corporation anymore. The easiest thing is to pay the startup to go away, enrich the startup founders and slowly collapse the startup within the corporation. After years of stress and round the clock focus you can't really blame the startup founders for taking the payday. Assuming they pay tax on the payday their society benefits too. But if the Big Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Meta had taken the early payday offered to them they wouldn't be around today. It is the David Goggins of the world that refuse to cave, cash in and instead continue running.

Perhaps the hardest ethical turnstile of all is the next one that presents itself. This is where you attract the attention of the state. You think the initial Twitter founders ever thought they would kick a sitting US President off their platform? You think the initial Google founders ever thought that search results would need to be tweaked to promote the "diversity" agenda? You think that the initial Amazon founders ever thought that certain books wouldn't be able to be sold because they challenged the state narrative? Or you think Elon Musk ever thought he would be chatting to UK Prime Ministers about the illusory threat of artificial general intelligence (AGI) when he was designing SpaceX rockets and Tesla cars? At this point the company is so large it is inevitable it gets infiltrated by the state. In the Bitcoin industry, the industry I'm most familiar with, I've seen the same happen to a company like Coinbase that initially created the best software for buying and selling of Bitcoin only to turn to ramming all kinds of total scams and Ponzi schemes down their customers' throats (derogatorily labelled s\*\*\*coins). I've obviously never reached this ethical turnstile or the one before it for that matter hence I don't know what I'd do or be able to do. But when the state is as incompetent and/or malicious as it is in the UK in 2024 not only do fewer and fewer people reach this ethical turnstile it is frightening what the UK state would do to them if they did. The US state is clearly far from perfect as we've seen in recent years with the evolution of these tech giants but the UK state is a complete nightmare. At least in the US they have churned out wealth generating companies before neutering them. The UK state has neutered their people's ambition before they have even started.

## 20 The role of state education in leaving the white working classes to rot

In football the most promising kids and teenagers from all classes, races, religions etc are scouted, offered places in academies and given the support so that they have the best chance of maximizing and utilizing their potential as a professional footballer in their adult lives. They get access to the best coaches, the best training facilities and they get to compare themselves and compete with other highly talented youngsters. Do they all succeed as professional footballers? Of course not. Is it possible that a late bloomer ends up having a more successful career than someone offered an academy place at an early age? Of course. But generally today's stars in the Premier League were found early and invested in early. If they move to another club they can generate transfer fees for the original club academy that invested time and money in them. And with the connections they build with future professionals, coaches and support staff it is possible that even if they don't make it as a professional footballer they can still find a role in the industry as say an agent or coach. Compare that experience to a white working class kid in the UK who is gifted academically. He goes to the local state school, coasts, is amused by how little work he needs to do to maintain good grades, gets bored and ends up disrupting other kids' education. When the exams come around he works harder and comes out of that school top of his year. In comparison to the upper classes he gets zero support for particular admissions processes to the top universities but he gets into a decent university on the back of his grades. He spends two and a half years at that university getting drunk every night and only when his grades start dropping to concerning levels does he start studying hard and manages to leave university with a Upper Second and a Masters in a science despite his professors (barring one) previously writing him off. He then goes into the world of work as an adult with no real network to speak of on any of the key metrics that matter: wealth, influence, intelligence and ambition. It is the complete opposite experience of the gifted footballer. Is it any wonder that the Premier League is beamed into television screens all around the world while the startup scene languishes in comparison to the US or Israel? Is it a surprise that the UK state has been phasing out and banning grammar schools, the nearest equivalent to a football academy which tries to identify gifted youngsters, provide the best education programs to them and allows them to compare themselves and compete with other gifted youngsters? In a national strategy of managed decline smart, white working class kids are surplus to requirements. They don't meet the painting by numbers hiring requirements and the state doesn't care if they spend their whole lives doing minimum wage work.

Again if you truly wanted a diverse meritocracy rather than this hideous upper class oligopoly with a sprinkle of painting by numbers "diversity" what would you do differently? The first step would be to move as far away as possible from the socialist mindset that every white working class person is the same and should be subject to exactly the same education contrived by the incompetent and/or malicious state. As always in a socialist system the upper classes aren't subject to what the white working classes are subjected to. They go to fee paying schools, invest in one on one tutoring and if their kid shows a particular interest or talent for a subject they can ask a friend or pay an expert to speak to their kid about that subject. Despite the state education system and state media giving the impression that the only people that matter are royalty and politicians there are still businesses in the UK, many formed pre the national strategy of managed decline, that still and always will need skilled practitioners in science and technology. Why the state with its upper class humanities graduates thinks it should exclusively make decisions on a universal state education system is just another layer of the complacent arrogance that it shows in every aspect of its sprawling empire. There are many towns and cities especially in the north of England and Scotland that have fallen into abject poverty and present no hope or opportunity to kids growing up there. What do they have to lose by shaping their education to leave them best placed to get jobs at whatever businesses have a presence in their area? Can their prospects get any worse than they currently are? Will they really lose out by not learning about Henry VIII and World War 2 and instead learning about accountancy, business, software development, engineering, whatever skills those local businesses need? Trump asked black voters in 2016 "What do you have to lose?" These towns and cities have nothing to lose. The upper class, humanities graduates of the state have failed them and other than writing these towns and cities off as failed historical ruins they can't sink any lower. They are in a state of cardiac arrest and practically any electric jolt you can give them is better than the status quo.

Is there a role for some kind of state oversight? Of course. An education program for extremist terrorists shouldn't be allowed, nor should an education program teaching students to hate their country's history and values. An education program trying to stoke up race wars by teaching that a certain race has permanent victimhood status and another race has permanent oppressor status should be clamped down on, not that the state seems to be doing anything to clamp down on teachers spouting critical race theory in 2024. Similarly an education program encouraging kids to permanently mutilate their bodies when they go through a teenage phase should be clamped down on, again not a priority for the state in 2024 who would rather lock up the parents for protecting their kids. There are two falsehoods that the state has brainwashed generation after generation with. One is that the state cares about its citizens more than say a business. It doesn't. Businesses want your money and politicians want your vote. The state does not care about you and your family any more than a business does. The second is that the state cares about kids' welfare as much as parents and a family structure. It doesn't. There will always be cases of terrible parenting and thankfully rare cases of parental abuse of their kids. But as a generalization there is no comparison. The state does not care and parents care more than anything else about their kids. By empowering the state over parents you just ensure that terrible, indifferent parenting is the norm and muddy the waters for those good parents who left alone without state interference would ensure much better outcomes for their kids. The state is a universal incompetent and indifferent parent. Are there incompetent and indifferent parents too? Of course. But there are also competent, loving parents. And they shouldn't be in a battle with the state on how to raise and educate their kids. Again "What do you have to lose?" when you look at the depths the state has sunk to in recent years. The state would do nothing for decades as "Sir" Jimmy Savile roamed the childrens' wards and Muslim grooming gangs roamed the streets of Huddersfield. The state is not your friend and it certainly isn't your loving parent.

## 21 Brexit - the revolution that never happened

"The victory of the Leave campagin owed more to the fundamental dsyfunction of the British Establishment than it did to any brilliance from Vote Leave. Despite having the support of practically every force with power and money in the world (including the main broadcasters) and controlling the timing and legal regulation of the referendum, they blew it. This was good if you support Leave but just how easily the whole system could be taken down should be frightening for everybody" Dominic Cummings

In June 2016 the UK had a referendum on whether it should leave the European Union (EU) approximately four decades after joining (1973). As is usual with elections the media covered it 24/7, the politicians thrilled in their increased celebrity status, battle buses were bought, 33 million votes were cast and the voter turnout was a very healthy 72 percent. According to the Electoral Commission the referendum cost 129 million British pounds. Sitting in a Californian co-working space I didn't give the Brexit side a chance. All the major UK political parties opposed it, the UK state and state adjacent media opposed it, the Bank of England opposed it, the civil service refused to assist Brexit supporting politicians and the sitting US President (Barack Obama) opposed it. Obama visited the UK in person stating in a speech the UK would be at the "back of the queue" for a US trade deal if it voted for Brexit before being warmly greeted by Prince William and Prince Harry. The Canadian Bank of England governor, Mark Carney described the prospect of Brexit as the most significant risk to the UK's financial stability. (After the vote he warned leaving the EU without a deal could result in house prices crashing 30 percent.) To top it all off a MP campaigning against Brexit was shot days before the vote, a tragedy that was used to demonize Brexit supporters further. And yet despite all that the UK electorate voted by a narrow margin (52 percent to 48 percent) to leave the EU. This was a Trump sized shock and really should have been a wake up call that the UK people no longer believed the state's lies and threats. As a commenter (Roseanne Curran) on the political strategist Dominic Cummings' blog put it "Thank you for a good job, well done. Exciting times ahead". But alas. Instead Brexit was delayed in Parliament, in the upper chamber (the House of Lords) in the UK Supreme Court, no doubt by the vast majority of the civil service and only completed after another general election in December 2019 in which the now Conservative leader Boris Johnson campaigned to "Get Brexit done" as if the referendum result wasn't a clear enough instruction in the first place. Three years the UK population will never get back. Little did they know they were a year away from being subjected to the state's response to Covid and another two years of being locked up in their homes watching the daily government briefings deciding which one of their freedoms was going to be taken away on any given day. In summary I think it is fair to say Brexit did not deliver the revolution it promised and the two years of Covid lockdowns served to demolish the UK small business landscape and government finances almost as a state enforced punishment for voting the wrong way. In the upcoming national election (2024) "Sir" Keir Starmer is the strong favorite to become Prime Minister, an ardent opponent of Brexit and someone who argued for even longer, more stringent Covid lockdowns than the mere two years. Assuming he completes a full term that will end in 2028 or 2029 which will be 12 years from the Brexit referendum vote.

Now after 12 years you really should be able to see some dividends from a supposedly significant decision like leaving the EU. But for the vast majority of those 12 years the state has tried to prevent it from happening, tried to stall progress on delivering those dividends, locked the population up in their homes for two years and installed unelected leaders who seem determined not to deliver on any of the opportunities Brexit presented in the first place. It is yet another example of the slyness of the state. They haven't been able to deliver the economic crash or the property crash they warned about but they have delivered on neutering Brexit to such an extent that the electorate looks back over the last 12 years and is utterly devoid of hope that anything can be changed. Even after a once in a generation referendum in which the people managed to (somehow) deliver a result every branch of the state was determined to prevent, even after all that, barely anything changed. Northern towns and cities are still in abject poverty, third world immigrants still swamp their local areas and the potential Brexit was supposedly going to unleash is nowhere to be seen. And like that Brexit was gone. Extinguished by the usual suspects.

The Brexit vote should have led to the dismantling of the state, the bonfire of EU regulations and the chaos of a Trump first term. After taxes had poured in from all sides to fund the state machine whose primary objective was to prevent the Brexit side winning it couldn't even achieve that. Half of those taxes presumably paid by taxpayers who actually wanted the Brexit side to win and so were forced to fund the opposite of what they wanted and the opposite of what they ultimately voted for. This highlights again why your plain vanilla Trump isn't enough in the UK and you need the Trump on steroids. The state is too powerful, has its tentacles in every possible crevice and even the strawmen and strawwomen who put their faces on a campaign against the state's wishes delivered next to nothing as a result. It goes without saying that this is not the sign of a healthy country or a healthy democracy. Representatives can swan around the globe discussing their "beacon of democracy" and "mother of all parliaments" all they like but if you spend years on one particular issue, you ask your electorate to participate in a once in a generation referendum and then you don't deliver anything as a result your democracy has flatlined. You are wasting people's time and you are burning taxpayers' hard earnt money all for a political charade and an ego trip. You might as well just install a dictator for life like in North Korea, China or nominally Russia, stop burning taxpayer cash and they can make the decisions on whether to stay in the EU or not.

## 22 Human rights for the terrorists and child rapists, zero rights for the victims

In a supposedly developed, first world society there has to be a balance of rights between the accused and the accuser or the apparent victim. Principles such as "innocent before proven guilty" are there to prevent lives being ruined by false accusations which don't stand up to scrutiny in court. You cannot just automatically "believe all victims" like the "Me too" (2017) collective hysteria suggested because some of those supposed victims will be lying. Some will be seeking revenge, some will be seeking attention, some will regret their past actions and seek to pass the blame to someone else and others will be seeking a payday. You can't throw say a US President in jail for 10 years because a woman accuses him of a sexual assault that according to her occurred decades ago with no evidence other than her word. Hence there is a legal system to scrutinize accusations and assess whether the accused is guilty of those accusations. But like everything else in the UK the legal system seems to be rotting from the inside and the entire pathway from accusation to court judgment to sentencing seems to have collapsed. With crime plaguing cities all over the country from child sexual abuse to murder to rape to burglaries why do the police even consider arresting a 12 year old boy for misguided insults sent to a footballer on social media? A 12 year old boy whilst other 12 year olds are being groomed for sexual abuse? How does any human brain decide to spend police resources on something like that? Should that 12 year old child have been disciplined by his parents and say his school for sending those racist messages? Of course. Were those messages unacceptable? Of course. But he is a 12 year old boy and there are adult grooming gangs out there. What is wrong with them?

Let's first be clear on what these grooming gangs are doing to kids in towns and cities all over the country. Plied with alcohol and drugs, raped, passed around so they are raped multiple times, beaten, enslaved and ultimately blackmailed by their abusers. All while the majority of the perpetuators becry "racism" if these crimes are investigated by the police. In the rare cases that these crimes go to trial and the accused are found guilty the BBC, the legal system and the state will argue for millions of taxpayer money being spent defending the human rights of these perpetuators all while the victims languish in poverty with their lives in ruins. This is not that balance of rights you would expect in a supposedly developed, first world society. That is a third world hellhole. In El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has built vast prisons and implemented policies that have reduced the homicide rate from 38 per 100,000 in 2019 to 7.8 in 2022 (New York Times, February 2024). What do BBC journalists do? Travel to El Salvador, paid for by the British people's compulsory license fee to criticise those policies on the basis of human rights. All while children are being groomed for sexual abuse in towns and cities all over their home country. Are there human rights concerns with locking up such large numbers of people in such a short space of time? Of course. Will there be a large legal backlog to work through to assess which of those prisoners are innocent and don't pose a risk to their societies? Of course. But why does the BBC only care about the human rights of the criminals? Why does it never raise concerns of the human rights of those murdered and raped? Whose human rights matter more? A 12 year old sexually abused by a grooming gang or the grooming gang itself? Why is it ok to spend millions of taxpayer money on a legal case determining whether that grooming gang is deported or not while the abused 12 year old retreats to her abject poverty in a northern city completely let down by the authorities her family pays taxes to to protect her? And why is Tommy Robinson thrown in prison for raising her concerns in public? This is not the UK that our ancestors grew up in. This is a sick and evil society. 

## 23 Itamar Ben-Gvir - Offering hope for Israel's future

With the current and longest serving Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu aged 74 the obvious question is what next? After a lifetime defending and rebuilding Israel in the military and political arenas will someone be able to pick up the mantle and not succumb to the predators running amok in the UK and the West. The best hope seems to be the individual getting the most heat from those in the process of destroying their own societies. An effective rule of thumb in today's upside down world is to find those who are being demonized in the mainstream media, work out what is driving that hatred and more often than not it is because their loyalties lie with their country and their religion rather than the global super rich. In Itamar Ben-Gvir's case he has spent his life worried about his family's and his community's safety in the West Bank (referred to as Judea and Samaria within Israel). His wife Ayala recently stated "I live in Hebron, mother of six sweet kids, travel through terrorism-ridden roads, married to the most threatened man in the country, and yes, I have a gun. Deal with it" (The New Yorker). Whilst the BBC's heroes are raping defenceless British kids, the Ben-Gvirs are defending Israeli kids and that's in essence why the BBC and the mainstream media despises them. Unlike Tommy Robinson in the UK who hasn't been able to make inroads into the mainstream media or mainstream politics and still gets arrested on a regular basis for innocuously walking around with his kids, Itamar Ben-Gvir has. He leads the Otzma Yehudit party and makes up a key part of Benjamin Netanyahu's current ruling coalition as Minister of National Security. He was in the process of setting up a national guard to focus on terrorism months before the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7th 2023. It is inevitable that whenever Israel completes its military action against Hamas in Gaza that the terrorist threat will be a major priority of the Israeli electorate in any future election. Although Ben-Gvir doesn't have some of the same skillsets that Netanyahu has refined during his long career it is also the case that the Israel Netanyahu would be passing on is much stronger than the Israel he inherited. Ben-Gvir wouldn't need an economic strategy for addressing hyperinflation, he wouldn't need a strategy for laying the foundations of a technology and startup ecosystem and it is arguable whether he'd need to be particularly convincing on why the two state solution is a non-starter. Of course Israel's enemies want to entrap it in a permanent cycle of terrorism, violence and military weakness but all Ben-Gvir needs to do is point to the events of October 7th. There is still much more work to do and Israel cannot afford to be complacent in any era. But the Israel Netanyahu will ultimately hand on is a much stronger Israel than the one Netanyahu inherited. And that ultimately will be Netanyahu's legacy.         

## 24 Building up from first principles

There will be a national election in the UK in 2024 that barring a miracle will result in a Labour government or a Labour led coalition government. On the most important issues (Brexit, Covid, the economy, "diversity", crime and human rights) Labour have been on the wrong side of the Conservatives. As the Conservatives have been dragged ever leftwards the left wing party inevitably takes positions even further left than that. Hence it is reasonable to assume that a Labour government will be even worse than the Conservatives. Thankfully unlike the decade of the Labour government in 1997-2007 this time they don't have a charismatic leader (Tony Blair), they don't have a Chancellor of the Exchequer that the media will build up as a Midas like figure (Gordon Brown, who ironically sold half the nation's gold at the bottom of the gold market) and they don't have a spin doctor at the peak of his powers (Alastair Campbell). It is also widely understood by traditional Conservative voters that the "Conservative" government of 2010-2024 has ended up being nothing more than a marketing gimmick with a rotating door of different leaders. All seeking to be the true "heir to Blair" and a continuation of New Labour. So there will be an opportunity in 2028/2029 for a true right wing party that wasn't present say at the end of Blair and New Labour's first term. What state the country will be in then and whether there is anything to salvage is a different question. But even with the brain drain of the recent decades I highly doubt that in a population of 67 million people it isn't possible to find a few hundred people who wouldn't normally enter politics, who could earn much more money in the private sector but are so appalled by what is happening to their country that they want to at least try to pull the oil tanker around. Ideally they would have gone the Trump route and become wealthy before entering politics but other than the permanently rich upper classes, some footballers and some ethnic minority actors I'm not sure if you could find a few hundred people who have been able to generate serious wealth in this country in recent decades. So it may well be that those few hundred people will need donors domestically or from abroad.

Do you need money and how much money do you need? If mainstream media channels refuse to give your Tommy Robinsons or Joe Bloggs a platform so that they can build name recognition you are effectively in the same position as a startup business trying to acquire customers. In the Tommy Robinson case you are also fighting against the tide of years of demonization in the mainstream media and the branding of being a criminal with some prison stays on your CV. Rather than starting at zero you are starting at a very large negative number. To make progress in turning this around would potentially need even more money than a startup starting at zero and with nonexistent brand recognition. Compare this to the experience of the royal family who get the equivalent of millions of dollars of free publicity in the mainstream media every day driving home the message that these people are important to people's lives and worth idolising when in reality the opposite is generally the case. One difference versus a startup business is that to become a MP you can focus your resouces on your chosen constituency numbering in the tens of thousands of people rather than the tens of millions of people. You can make significant progress on the ground assuming you have large amounts of time to invest in voter canvassing and you are comfortable approaching strangers. This is where the Trumps of the US have a much greater advantage than your Trumps of the UK. A US President doesn't need to be elected to represent a particular local area prior to running for the US President whilst a UK Prime Minister must not only be elected to lead a political party he or she also needs to have been elected as a MP for a particular constituency. If they are not a MP they are unable to enter the race to become UK Prime Minister. It is quite possible that Trump would have struggled with the minutiae of rubbish collections and road potholes as a local MP on that prerequisite stepping stone to running for Prime Minister. Or perhaps with his wealth he would have just delegated most of the responsibilities and succeeded in doing the bare minimum. He had incredible name recognition prior to running for political office after all, he had an incredible network through his career as a businessman, he understood the political system and he had his own money to spend without needing to rely on donors.

## 25 The curious case of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings

Most of the modern UK Prime Ministers who have lasted for relatively long periods of time have achieved it due to a partnership with a closely aligned, generally loyal Chancellor of the Exchequer. Margaret Thatcher had Nigel Lawson, Tony Blair had Gordon Brown and David Cameron had George Osborne. In all of these cases it was a genuine partnership of equals with no obvious junior partner. If anything you could argue that the nominally junior role of Chancellor was regarded as the smarter one driving policy decisions with the nominally senior partner fronting up those policy decisions with the media and opposition parties. In the technology world you see a similar dynamic with CEOs (Chief Executive Officers) and CTOs (Chief Technology Officers). Steve Jobs was the face and public voice of Apple but even he would admit that Steve Wozniak was the smarter technologist driving the development of early Apple products. The skillsets for these two roles are very different. Decision making based on logic and data does not require any charisma whatsoever whilst the media seems to value charisma over all else including competence. Similarly computers, programming and software development do not require charisma at all. A computer will ignore how charismatic you are and will execute code regardless of whether that code was written by Steve Jobs or a lifeless robot. It gets a little more complicated when you start to think about groups of humans writing code as the computer doesn't care about charisma but the humans potentially do. Even so programmers will generally be motivated by better, more experienced programmers who are capable of solving their problems. In the software world problems are bugs, vulnerabilities and code that fails to execute or exits with an error message. On the charisma spectrum Boris Johnson is potentially a 10. Without Boris Johnson fronting up the Brexit campaign you would expect that the UK would still be in the EU especially as the 52:48 winning margin was so narrow. So why after completing two terms as Mayor of London, widely considered as effective especially when compared to his predecessor and successor, was he unable to complete a single term as Prime Minister and presided over one of the most horrifying state failures during Covid? Although there are certainly questions over the (in)competence of everyone from his Cabinet to his civil servants to his background staff and indeed questions over whether he himself was entirely unsuited to front up a response to an unexpected national emergency of which he was unable to understand or process, there was the additional problem that he was missing his Nigel Lawson. His Chancellor during Covid was Rishi Sunak, not only more loyal to the Cameron, Osborne side of the party who were fiercely anti-Brexit (although peculiarly Sunak did seem to support Brexit during the campaign perhaps for strategic reasons) but also whose resignation led to Johnson being driven out as Prime Minister during his first term with Sunak later taking over himself. The media perception and arguably the reality was that the partnership that drove the Brexit campaign's success and Johnson's brief reign as Prime Minister was the partnership between Johnson and an unelected strategic advisor, Dominic Cummings.

There were a couple of obvious problems with this partnership that weren't specific to the individual. First of all Cummings was unelected, he wasn't a MP and so unlike previous Chancellors Cummings could be demonized by the media and opposition parties as pulling the strings of the administration without a democratic mandate to do so. Secondly he had no direct control of the nation's purse strings that a Chancellor nominally does. If Sunak wanted to pay the UK population to stay at home during multiple Covid lockdowns and pay people to eat out in restaurants in between lockdowns someone in Cummings' position would be unable to prevent it without getting the Prime Minister involved. Then we have to delve into the persona of Cummings himself which clearly requires greater degrees of speculation and personal opinion. From reading his blog posts and following his recent career through the prism of the mainstream media he seems like a rare publicly known individual that can identify the multitude of problems that the UK faces after 80 years of managed decline and does actually care enough to dedicate time into thinking about the nature of those problems. But unless he is keeping longer term plans up his sleeve he seems to be much weaker at formulating potential long term solutions and often seems no less scatterbrained than Johnson himself. In a partnership where Johnson had the charisma covered it is highly questionable whether Cummings brought to the table the temperament, the long term strategy, the ability to build alliances and the ability to manoeuvre around enemies. He has been involved in politics for approximately two decades and after all that time it is not clear at least publicly if he has any allies left that he doesn't think are entirely useless. In a population of 67 million people it is highly doubtful that Cummings is the lone genius and that there aren't others either already in the fold or who could be brought into the fold that could help contribute to longer term solutions that Cummings supports. But from reading his blog posts it is not clear who those people are. Barring installing Cummings as Prime Minister and dictator for life he would need allies to deliver any potential solutions, not that he seems to be particularly clear on what those solutions would be. Anyone attempting to formulate solutions, especially long term solutions, has to be able to identify where their personal weaknesses and blind spots are. It is not clear that Cummings has this epistemic humility. He has some very strong views on the importance of science and technology for example (that I personally agree with) but he himself graduated in a humanities subject (history). As I've found to my cost trying to catch up with those already trained in a skillset (software development, computer science) when you are trained in a different subject (mathematics) is a challenge. Some are just as smart as you, sometimes smarter than you, and if they also started training earlier than you it is very difficult to catch up let alone surpass them. I would also argue that mathematics gives you a stronger foundation to start exploring a different science or technology than the dataless, superficial narrative spinning of most history books. To be fair to Cummings he does highlight that he had to make decisions outside of his "circle of competence" and that he didn't have the "sort of expertise supporting the PM and ministers that is needed". Though he also hopes to be "largely redundant" within a year which is farcical given the long term problems he is attempting to solve. More evidence of being good at highlighting problems but flimsy in the formulation of long term solutions.   

In Cummings' defense Boris Johnson does sound impossible to manage. Cummings described Johnson as a "shopping trolley smashing between aisles" during Covid and hence a strategy of wheeling out a charisma machine during an election campaign but restraining him whilst governing seems as if it was harder in practice than it was in theory. Perhaps it would have been easier had a national emergency never presented itself and the focus had been on taking advantage of Brexit opportunities. Cummings suggests he knew Johnson was unfit to be Prime Minister in 2019 but thought trying to control him was the best of a bad job. By 2021 Cummings was trying to remove him "helped by officials in No.10 and Whitehall appalled by his behavior", behavior that included "pathological lying and surrounding himself with courtier fools". Johnson talked in public about growth and lower taxes but was the one who stopped plans for growth and lower taxes. Instead he was interested in trains, buses, bike lanes, a bridge or tunnel to Ireland and "buildings he could interpret in Roman Emperor terms". Perhaps most worryingly of all Johnson supposedly had a "money's just digits in a computer" attitude to taxes and spending. He saw the PM job as a "glorified version of being Mayor with better perks". Reading through Cummings' account of his time in No.10 you do start to wonder if whatever his own personal faults (everyone has faults) he was on a hiding to nothing with Johnson. But then according to Cummings Liz Truss was a "human handgrenade", Sunak "spends his time wading through endless detail and spreadsheets on fifth order matters" and perhaps most illuminating of all Netanyahu is a "disaster and the sooner he's replaced the better" despite Cummings admitting he'd "never followed Israeli politics in any detail". So you do wonder whether even if a potential leader presented themselves with a clone of Cummings' brain he'd still be seeking to oust them within a year or two.     

## 26 The Cummings diagnosis

However, on identifying and analyzing the problems of the UK state there seems to be no one better. So what is the Cummings' diagnosis? Parts are obvious to anyone observing from the outside whilst other parts benefit from Cummings' experience of operating directly within the belly of the beast. You can't really start anywhere else other than with people. If you are trying to take advantage of Brexit opportunities having a team that didn't want Brexit to happen, still harbors resentment that their side lost and perhaps still hopes that the UK could rejoin the EU at some point in the future then you're not going to get very far. It would be the equivalent of trying to get a group of individuals to win a football match when they're determined to play cricket instead. The economic opportunity Brexit presented was to not be bound by EU regulations when trading with nations outside the EU. You obviously still have to follow EU regulations when trading with nations inside the EU but when you've left the EU you are no longer captive to those EU regulations when trading with nations that are outside. With the highest growing economies today in Asia, South America and Africa this allows you to embark on a multi alignment strategy. EU regulations and EU trade deals become irrelevant when trading with these economies. The other opportunity is to define what you think UK regulations should be. Do they become the bare minimum needed to trade with another country and hence fall back to whatever regulations that trading partner has? Does the UK define a new set of regulations, perhaps a subset of the existing EU regulations that makes trade a little more onerous than the bare minimum but still less onerous than EU regulations? There are a lot of questions to answer but the inevitable answer with a team of anti Brexit people is that the UK stays aligned with EU regulations entirely as if it had never left. Now that the UK has left the EU there is no excuse for the team to not be entirely filled with people that want to leverage the economic opportunities Brexit presents. That includes both elected politicians and civil servants who seemingly want jobs for life whilst also ignoring and resisting the will of the electorate.

Whilst in Number 10 as Boris Johnson's Chief Advisor Cummings released a much derided blog post calling for the hiring of "data scientists, project managers, policy experts, assorted weirdos". Transitioning from a mindset of "we blindly follow EU regulations" to "we can follow whatever regulations we want with a bare minimum set by the trading partner" certainly required a mentality shift. Asking the existing civil servants, generally upper class with humanities degrees and still bitter that Brexit happened at all to perform that shift was always going to be an uphill task. Hence hiring and firing was always going to be key. This is also where businesses (ideally small as well just large) who had experience of trading with these economies and aspirations to increase trade with these economies should have been coming to the fore. A lean and effective state that actually wants to grow its economy and actually wants its citizens to become wealthier solves problems for businesses and/or for the electorate. If it isn't solving problems or worse expanding the list of problems then it is just a millstone around its electorate's neck. Too often it takes the BBC's "holier than thou" approach where it thinks that nothing good can happen unless it is directed and driven by the state. And that the state is the only thing that can prevent bad things from happening. As we've seen with everything from Brexit to Covid it seems like today the opposite is the case. It prevents good things from happening and it turns bad things into horrendous things.

"To get good government you must have good people in charge of government. I have observed in the last 40 years that even with a poor system of government but with a good, strong people in charge people get passable government with decent progress. On the other hand I have seen many ideal systems of government fail. Britain and France between them wrote over 80 constitutions for their different colonies. Nothing wrong with the constitution, with the institutions and the checks and the balances. But the societies did not have the leaders who could work those institutions nor the people who respected those institutions. The leaders who inherited these constitutions were not equal to the job and their countries failed and their system collapsed in riots, in coups and in revolution" Lee Kuan Yew

The UK does not have good people in charge of government and it won't have for the next 4-5 years at the very least. It is clearly ironic that the country who wrote so many constitutions for its colonies all across the globe in previous centuries now can't even manage its own affairs effectively. Brain drain, a declinist mindset (as opposed to say a growth or a fixed mindset) and a desire to pillage the taxpayer base has got it here and as Lee Kuan Yew says without good people no system will get you out of that hole. However, a large part of the Cummings diagnosis is focused on systems hence we should explore or at least summarize his thinking here. The UK government system, according to Cummings, is a combination of extreme centralization of power, an extremely powerful bureaucracy closed to outside people, incentives to spew rules rather than solve problems and a media programmed to spread confusion. It possesses few of the error correcting mechanisms seen in say markets or the scientific method so it cannot improve itself let alone fix itself. If anything every failure or scandal is used to buttress the existing system. Set up a hideously long and expensive public enquiry enriching your lawyer friends, introduce more laws and/or state bodies led by insiders, find some outsiders to blame and demonize. Rinse and repeat. Rather than ruthlessly imposing simplicities so that there can be some transparency and accountability for actual outcomes, there is an ever expanding Byzantine web of subentities with overlapping responsibilities, conflicting objectives and a need to overreach into grey areas better left to the market to justify their existence. Elected ministers can't hire and fire and are almost never in a job long enough to acquire sufficient knowledge and understanding of their department. If Cummings is correct in this assessment you should not vote in elections unless you have local reasons for doing so. At a national level not only is your individual vote mathematically irrelevant but any individual you vote for won't be able to implement the manifesto they are running on. Your time would be much better spent voting with your wallet by considering your purchasing and investment decisions and voting with your feet by moving to countries (if you can) that have already implemented the policies you support. Your democracy is a mirage.

"If the people have lost faith completely in their democratic institutions because they cannot find people of caliber to run them, however good that system, it perishes. Ultimately it is the people who run the system who make it come to life." Lee Kuan Yew

As I write this I am pretty confident half of the UK population that voted for Brexit and most of the right wing have lost faith completely in British democratic institutions. Hence the system could perish but waiting around for that to happen does not seem like a good strategy to me. Not only could it take much longer than you hope the debris of that collapsing system could very well take you and your life prospects with it.      

## 27 Flaws with the Cummings diagnosis

Building good software is fiendishly hard. Not only are there very few developers capable of designing and implementing a robust and adaptable architecture (and no Rishi Sunak AI does not solve this problem) the few of them there are generally won't work for a government salary. Even in the US where it is much more common for individuals to move between enterprise and government ambitious software projects are inevitably a complete disaster. The most shocking example in the last decade was "Obamacare" and the software backing the Affordable Care Act. As The Atlantic put it "The Obama adminstration was running the biggest startup in the world and they didn't have anyone who had run a startup or even run a business". The website crashed on launch and was beset with problem after problem despite the Obama adminstration throwing billions of dollars in its direction ($2.1 billion estimate by Bloomberg in 2014). Some of the best examples of software like Google or Facebook that probably peaked at a similar time to the Obamacare disaster succeeded for a number of different reasons. Firstly, the founders and later hires were incentivized to build something that worked and wouldn't later crumble as they held stock in the company. A consultant coming in to salvage the Obamacare software did not care what happened after he or she was paid and so was incentivized to make short term fixes and add sticking plasters. Secondly, Google and Facebook started small and organically with small numbers of skilled developers to get something that worked at a small scale first. Paul Graham of the startup accelerator Y Combinator in Silicon Valley is known for the saying "Do things that don't scale". Rushing straight from zero to nine rather than Peter Thiel's zero to one was arguably too big a task for even early Google or Facebook engineers not that Obamacare had access to them. Thirdly, unlike say Mark Zuckerberg who has been at Facebook (now Meta) for 20 years a US President or a political party can be kicked out and replaced in an election that typically happens every 4-5 years. If that ambitious software project is no longer a priority or worse abandoned entirely then what motivation does a skilled software engineer have to be associated with such a failure and have it on their CV especially as they most likely took a pay cut to work on it in the first place. Everything is pointing to the state doing the bare minimum when it comes to building or overseeing software projects itself. Any software it does build should be open source so taxpayers can see what they are getting for their money and if they are so inclined recommend changes to. Plus it should be as simple as possible so that it still stands a chance of being used in 5 years let alone 10 or 20. Every choice in that software stack should be as vanilla and as conservative as possible. Although Cummings appreciates how software has changed (eaten) the world and how Silicon Valley has almost exclusively built out that software it isn't clear that he understands how challenging it is for the state to succeed with ambitious software projects nor how consultants or Big Tech companies typically enrich themselves with taxpayer cash on the back of the stupidity (and/or corruption) of the state. The Sunaks of the state being misdirected down garden paths of fantasy like artificial general intelligence (AGI) by Silicon Valley billionaires is unfortunately not the exception but the rule.        

## 28 The future for the UK: a grandparent in a care home or a rebirth? 

"America became the province of the mind, Israel the province of the heart" Benjamin Netanyahu

The United States is showing signs of age after a couple of centuries. Hopefully it is just at a particularly bad trough within an inevitable cycle. Indeed it has rebounded before from the Civil War and the Great Depression and I wouldn't bet against it rebounding again. But if America is showing signs of age where does that leave the UK? Depending on whether you measure its age from the Act of Union (1707) or the formation of England, Scotland and Wales (10th and 11th century) the UK is either marginally older or many centuries older than the US. Does it have a role anymore? Or is it that grandparent in a care home seeing out its last years reminiscing about its peak years whilst its children and grandchildren occasionally visit to pay their respects? Many signs are not good to put it mildly. The home of the industrial revolution has sat out most of the internet and software revolution which is increasingly running rings around the world of atoms. Not only does that mean UK citizens haven't built out the skills and expertise to contribute to this new world it also means that children don't strive to be the next Steve Wozniak or Mark Zuckerberg because it seems like an alien world. The wealth and adulation of footballers is on their doorstep but they don't think about the code that is driving TikTok recommendations, they just mindlessly consume them. When a young Netanyahu went to learn about the future and how Israel could thrive in it he didn't go to study in the UK he went to US. And this was in the 1970s. I certainly think it is possible that in future decades that the equivalent of a young Netanyahu might choose to stay and study in Israel rather than the US. It very much depends on whether the US can rebound and whether Israel can continue on its current trajectory. Personally I hope both happen and then this young Netanyahu equivalent will be spoilt for choice. But from a UK perspective the irrelevance of the UK in this conundrum should be chilling. As UK students deface a portrait of Lord Balfour of the Balfour Declaration (March 2024) at the University of Cambridge, nominally one of the UK's top two universities, even its role as a country sized history museum seems under threat. The future is extinguished, the present looks bleaker every day and the last thing to be done is to destroy the emblems of its past.   

For a rebirth to even be remotely possible a number of dominoes have to fall into place. The first and perhaps most critical piece is facing the stark realities. As Obama said in his 2008 election campaign "You can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig". In the world of bits it is impossible to effectively put lipstick on a pig. If software doesn't work, it crashes, it is insecure, it is impossible to improve or it is unwieldy to the user it doesn't matter how good the branding or marketing of that software is. The lipstick runs off very quickly. Whilst in the world of atoms you can put good branding on a can of sugar and fizzy water and see the revenues pour in. In 2024, perhaps more at than at any point in human history, technical competence is the only game in town. The UK is not in a position to compete in that game after sitting out and watching from the sidelines for decades. But that game isn't going anywhere. If you want to participate in the space race, rewire financial transactions, win wars or understand what artifical intelligence is actually capable of you have to play the game. Even commentators aren't immune. Unlike a football game that they can watch with their own eyes the world of bits is in large part not visible to the untrained human eye. Any commentator without technical expertise is commentating on the equivalent of a football game with a blindfold on.

The second domino is transparently owning up to the failures that led to the stark realities of today. No rebirth can happen without a broad understanding and acknowledgement of why your country sunk to the depths in which it finds itself. Whilst it flounders in these absurd narratives on imaginary superiority complexes, virtue signaling and Brexit/EU delusions any potential rebirth has a probability of exactly zero. No sane individual should pin any hopes of a positive future when the state and the media is fiddling as Rome burns. Shimon Peres said "Politics divides, science unites" but politics can do much more harm than that. In the UK it has created an all consuming circus that has pulled in a large subsection of the supposedly brightest minds with the most expensive and privileged education on offer and generated no obvious positive long term returns over a system of chimpanzees pulling levers. Boris Johnson described UK politicians and perhaps all politicians as "crazed wasps in a jam jar each individually convinced that they are going to make it" (Channel 4). How has Israel (so far) not become one giant all consuming jam jar of crazed wasps? Some of the credit surely has to go to leaders like Netanyahu and Peres who saw politics as an unnecessary evil to be minimized rather than something to be obsessed over and celebrated. But also Israel's relative youth means it has a slimmed down Parliament (Knesset) of 120 members rather than the UK's 650 Members of Parliament (MPs) and 792 members in the House of Lords. The massively enlarged jam jar ensures there are ever more ferocious battles over smaller and smaller stakes similar to what Henry Kissinger observed in academia. Any attempts to slim down the jam jar are subject to a swarm of crazed wasps descending in your direction. Crazed wasps who have foolishly spent their lives focusing on politics rather than more productive pursuits that grow the economy and generate wealth rather than merely consume taxpayer money. And crazed wasps that ensure the fat man of the public sector continues to crush the shoulders of the thin man of the private sector to borrow a Netanyahu metaphor.

The third domino is a sustained elevation in standards from everyone from elected representatives to the media. In recent years observing discussions in the UK Parliament has been like watching the inside of a mental asylum. In good times Parliament can afford to only offer (not particularly good) light entertainment with the two major parties making snide jokes and playing a racism version of Punch and Judy trying to portray the opposing party as more "racist" than them. But in bad times when everything seems to be crumbling, the British people are becoming poorer and poorer in real terms (adjusted for consumer price inflation or worse property price inflation) and actual crimes (rather than thought police "crimes") go unpunished Parliament is lurching from dereliction of duty to downright negligence. This can only be solved by replacing existing MPs with MPs of a higher caliber. Whether that is a new party or the Conservative party losing the vast majority of its seats in the 2024 election and starting afresh there needs to be competent individuals in Parliament who want to solve the country's mounting pile of unsolved problems rather than just collect a pay cheque and some generous expenses. But these competent individuals need a subsection of the media to actually cover their efforts to solve problems rather than bombard them with racism Punch and Judy questions. That subsection of the media needs to be free from Ofcom dictates and free from the state that wants to crush aspiration, crush healthy public engagement in politics and keep people trapped in the racism Punch and Judy show. If these three dominoes were set up in a line a UK rebirth might be possible. But whilst they're not and the more time that goes on while they're not the grandparent in the care home is getting older, more frail and increasingly divorced from reality. The US takes on the role of the UK and Israel takes on the role of the US whilst the UK becomes a mere footnote in American and Israeli history books.

## 29 Devolution and the DeSantis premium

Brexit and leaving the EU broadly (though not perfectly) returned sovereignty and democratic accountability back to the UK. Like any freedom or gift bestowed on you that doesn't guarantee better outcomes. If you don't take advantage of that freedom or vengefully blame it for all your troubles then it isn't going to enhance your future. That's not an argument for leaving control in the hands of EU bureaucrats though. If your country is in danger of falling into third world status and global irrelevance you need to take as much control over its future trajectory as you can. Then if you fail at least you know it was through your own decision making and actions rather than because you were outsourcing those responsibilities to EU bureaucrats. The same rationale can be applied to devolution although to a weaker extent as voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland sent MPs to Westminster and could impact who the ruling parties and Prime Minister were prior to devolution. Devolution merely let them operate similar to how individual states do in the United States of America minimizing the dependence on federal government and allowing them the freedom to compete with eachother within bounds set by the federal government. In 2024 devolution in the UK seems like an absolute disaster. Scotland has spent most of the last decade trying to break up the UK as its citizens get more and more impoverished. The more powers given to the Scottish Parliament the more it has blamed Westminster. As it has gained responsibilities over its own fate it has increasingly sought to portray itself as a helpless victim. The Scottish Parliament building cost over 400 million pounds and the SNP (Scottish National Party), the ruling party in Scotland, has been mired in scandal after scandal with the ex leader (Nicola Sturgeon), ex leader's husband and ex Treasurer all arrested amidst financial irregularities. Rather than arguing against Covid lockdowns it argued for even more extended Covid lockdowns as if the economic consequences could then conveniently also be blamed on Westminster. You couldn't write a stronger cautionary tale on the dangers of devolution if you tried.

Why does it work in the United States and has so far been such a disaster in the UK? The United States still has its failures obviously but during Covid it could point to states such as Florida and Texas which took a very different course to the course the federal government was recommending and ended up doing much better economically than they would have done if they'd been entrapped by federal government dictates. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, became a household name during Covid keeping Florida open, overseeing an economic boom and enticing US citizens from all over the country to move to Florida, build businesses and bolster public services such as the police force. The UK didn't have a Florida and didn't have a Ron DeSantis during Covid and it doesn't look as if it will be getting one anytime soon. Part of it is a numbers game. The US has 50 states and the UK effectively has four (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland). This makes it less likely you'll see the outlier success stories. The US has also been the main beneficiary of the brain drain from the UK in recent decades and so it is questionable whether the UK has access to any politicians with the qualities of DeSantis. Post Covid I thought it would be hard for DeSantis to continue the momentum of showing the rest of the nation what was possible with strong conservative leadership but he hasn't slowed down. With Presidential like presentation he has announced legislation upon legislation on trade deregulation, education, law and order, squatters' rights and even deploying Florida soldiers to police the US border with Mexico. DeSantis has achieved this even with an adversarial federal government directly opposing his policies. It comes with the cost that a different state could perform appallingly and even worse than it would have done if it had just followed the federal government's instructions but in theory that state could eventually see the error of its ways with economic underperformance and outward migration and reverse course. Unfortunately the UK thus far has seen all the downsides of devolution with none of the upsides.

State education has this perennial problem that the majority of teachers are left wing. If you believe in capitalism, competition and a diverse meritocracy where enterprising, hard working and lucky individuals are financially rewarded for their efforts placing your child in a state education system almost certainly won't teach them those values. Teachers aren't particularly well paid (though they have long summer vacations), the better performing ones aren't financially rewarded for overperformance and the system doesn't really care whether they exit a particular school or the profession entirely hence the only leverage teachers really have over salary negotiations is by joining unions, threatening to close down schools and disrupting their students' educations. In recent times that problem has worsened as the left wing has morphed into additionally believing in critical race theory, gender fluidity and children making permanent decisions over their bodies pre adulthood. Parental decision making over education for their children was always important as they end up spending more time in classes with their teachers than with their parents. But in recent times it has become ever more critical. Make the wrong decision and not only might your child come back with a hatred of capitalism but they might be encouraged by their teacher to embark on life altering surgery to transition to the opposite gender with the SNP in Scotland threatening prison for the parents if they try to prevent it. This is providing worse outcomes to children than ditching the state education system entirely. The medical adage "first do no harm" is just another long term principle that the left wing is throwing out as it becomes ever more deranged.

It is easy to feel helpless as a parent faced with these threats. If you aren't blessed financially, have a full time job or worse multiple jobs, limited choice on which school your child can attend and no choice over the teachers allocated to your child what can you do? On top of that the state can throw you in prison for wanting to protect your child. This is where the DeSantis premium of living in Florida kicks in. Education reform has been a key pillar of the DeSantis administration. In 2021 he signed a bill preventing transgender females from playing womens' sports as the rest of the Western world seemingly sinks into allowing males transitioning to females to beat up biological females in boxing rings. He prohibited higher education institutions from allocating funding to support critical race theory and directed universities to report the numbers of students who were being prescribed permanent gender transitioning medical treatment. In 2022 he passed the Parental Rights in Education Act giving parents more control over what their children learned at school as always derided by the media who labelled it the "Don't Say Gay" bill. This included prohibiting classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through 3rd grade with school districts required to notify parents if there is a change in services regarding a child's mental, emotional or physical health or well-being. On top of that in 2023 he signed legislation raising total teachers' pay by 1 billion dollars with the average starting teacher salary raised to 48,000 dollars. As the Florida economy has boomed DeSantis has sought to reward and incentivize teachers while also extricating unions from basking in that capitalistic glow. DeSantis is an exceptional politician and leader but without freedom from the federal government he would have been unable to achieve what he has. Does that make up for other states imposing SNP like policies imprisoning parents trying to protect their kids? I don't know. But when the equivalent of your federal government is the SNP it is the only way hope for a better future isn't snuffed out entirely.

## 30 Bitcoin routing around the UK

There are many, many reasons the UK state is allergic to Bitcoin. Some of those reasons overlap with the explanations for the UK not participating or succeeding in the internet revolution and outsourcing technology expertise to the US. But there are additional reasons that are Bitcoin specific. The financial system before Bitcoin which we'll refer to perhaps prematurely as the legacy financial system relied heavily on points of centrality. London and New York were the primary financial centers, currency was issued and monetary policy was set by the central banks (Bank of England and Federal Reserve in the UK and US respectively) and regulatory agencies decided who could be banks and how those banks could operate. If you sit squarely in the middle of one of those points of centrality and derive your power and/or wealth by doing so Bitcoin is a nightmare. Here's something you know nothing about, with a monetary policy you can't manipulate, with holders able to secure their wealth outside of the banking system, with transactions that you can't prevent or cancel, with information on those transactions flowing around a global network outside of your control and with upstarts like El Salvador ahead of you in accumulating Bitcoin on its balance sheet. You'd feel sorry for them if they hadn't been inflating poor people's cash savings away for a decade and pumping up the asset prices of the super rich.

Returning to the UK from California in 2017 with debts, having failed to raise funds for a Bitcoin startup and more importantly having failed to obtain permanent access to the US was the lowest point of my life. At previous low points I had hope for the future and so it was just a case of dusting myself down and aiming bigger. In 2017 I had no hope. I'd spent most of my time in California sleeping in office space, a car and sometimes outside just so I could stay in the Silicon Valley ecosystem, where the Bitcoin developer meetups were, where the smart and ambitious people were, where the best universities were, where the investors in all the technology companies were, where the hope and aspiration were. Although I did everything I could to succeed with the startup, failures happen in the startup world. I was mentally prepared for needing to either pivot the startup or begin afresh but access to California was the lifeline. Without that I was struggling to set deadlines to stay alive by. I'd set a date where if I wasn't able to find some hope somewhere, something to work towards, someone to collaborate with or a romantic relationship I'd commit suicide. Suicide takes guts, it is a leap into the unknown that there's no coming back from. For every deadline that passed without doing it the more weak and useless I felt. If I couldn't even keep my word to myself why should anyone believe I would keep my word to them? I suspect suicide is a deeply personal thing and I don't think I should go further into the details lest I accelerate someone else's fall into the abyss. There weren't thoughts of anger or seeking revenge or anything like that. I was just convinced I had reached the end of the line.

Sheepishly I set up a Bitcoin developer meetup in London in 2018. I didn't expect anything, I knew there were very few Bitcoin developers in London or the UK and I knew that it would be a pale imitation of what I was used to in California. Most of the meetups were very poorly attended in the single figures though when there was an annual international conference in town there would be speakers from the US and outside the UK and much larger attendances. Simultaneously I started diving deeper into the protocol, the reference implementation (Bitcoin Core), Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), completing transcripts of presentations by Bitcoin developers I could find online, contributing to online Q&As on Bitcoin StackExchange and writing emails to the Bitcoin developer mailing list. I couldn't get funding for anything I was doing including the meetup but I assumed eventually I would. More and more developers were aware of me, no one seemed to dislike me and the small number of individuals allocating funding were also aware of what I was doing. In the meantime I did bar work and waiting restaurants in busy periods such as the run up to Christmas to obtain some kind of income. Then came the Covid lockdowns and the coordination of a global upgrade (Taproot) to the Bitcoin network from a bedroom of my parents' house.

I was very wary getting involved with it in the first place. The previous upgrade (SegWit) had been activated in the middle of a two year long block size war and a manic battle over Bitcoin's consensus rules that I had done everything in my power to steer clear from. Like in any war nuance or subtle technical arguments were thrown out the window and the vocal participants on everything from the code repository (GitHub) to social media (Twitter, Reddit etc) seemed to be getting ever more frenzied and deranged. Even though one side ultimately won ensuring blocks of transactions were kept relatively small there were individuals and factions even within the winning side who were at loggerheads on what should have been done or what shouldn't and whether certain threats or actions were justified. Although things had calmed down in the four years since and the losing side had effectively been cordoned off into an alternative currency (Bitcoin Cash) digging up the trauma and the animosity within the factions on the winning side was going to be painful and potentially time consuming. Even in Covid lockdowns I wasn't prepared to spend 2 years batting away swarms of abuse on social media for siding with one faction or another. I also knew that by descending into the hornets' nest and attempting to come out of it with a successful activation of an upgrade wasn't going to be cost free. It was inevitable I would end up upsetting some developers I had essentially been seeking to cultivate working relationships with. It was also very possible that if things turned ugly I'd become unfundable because the best way to get funding is to upset as few people as possible. But no one was picking it up. An upgrade designed and implemented by some of the people I'd essentially idolized in Silicon Valley was sitting there waiting to be activated and the longer it went without someone trying to activate it the greater the risk it would end up going stale and potentially never making it into a Bitcoin upgrade. So I picked it up in collaboration with a couple of other developers with the rationale that I'd try, I'd spend a couple of months on it and if I wasn't able to make any progress or it was descending back into a digital war like scenario I'd back out. What I didn't envisage was that I'd be successful in activating it, I would garner zero (or negative) credit for doing so, I wouldn't get funding and I'd be dragged back into new upgrade activation battles soon after that successful activation. I was shocked but perhaps this is what life is like for the Thatchers and Netanyahus. You can deliver what you set out to achieve, you can deliver what your community or constituency wants, you can gamble huge amounts of time and reputation for no obvious personal upside with zero financial compensation and you can be left on the scrapheap afterwards. If nothing else it made me want to highlight the efforts of and defend those who do the same. Because the world can be a hideously ungrateful and cold place.

The Taproot upgrade activated with only a minor hitch in November 2021. Practically all the complexity was in interacting with and marshalling humans who in the Bitcoin ecosystem tend to be higher on the autistic spectrum rather than any particular technical complexity. There were inevitable disagreements. Getting a group of people to agree on anything is difficult let alone a global community and pseudonyms you've never met or interacted with before. Any progress towards consensus could be punctured at any time by a single individual with a valid criticism, a concern for what could go wrong or merely a desire for attention. Move too fast and you're not giving the community the opportunity to review and participate in the discussion. Move too slow and you're deliberately drawing the discussion out for selfish or foolish reasons. The more progress that was made towards finalization the more individuals wanted to be associated with the discussion often without reviewing any of the previous discussion from recent weeks and months. The closer to the end the louder the calls for starting afresh and effectively throwing away the months of effort I and others had put in to get this far. I was definitely on edge for a lot of it. I was doing pretty much everything in public and it became obvious others were trying to push the discussion in different directions from the shadows and ignoring the public discussion. But I had individuals I could choose to lean on who had been involved with Bitcoin longer than I had, were much better programmers than I was and had been involved in prior activations. After Taproot had activated and what should have been my opportunity to go back to more interesting technical things I instead was battling seemingly alone to ensure the Taproot activation didn't open the door to new upgrades that could have set Bitcoin on a course that would have been much worse than if Taproot had never activated.

In early 2022 I was out of lockdown and out of my parents' spare bedroom. A Bitcoin developer was clamoring to get a new upgrade (CheckTemplateVerify) activated even though this upgrade, unlike the Taproot upgrade, was contentious. This effectively results in a similar situation to the block size war where one side wants to force through a upgrade whilst another side wants to prevent it. Attempting this months after the Taproot upgrade was absurd. Taproot had been a decade in the making, had taken a year to activate and if this new upgrade wasn't contentious it should have just been merged in with the Taproot upgrade rather than attempting two activations in quick succession. Others knew this, in some cases much better than I did, but similar to the Taproot activation they didn't want to become embroiled in another block size war. Hence I was doing my best to explain why it shouldn't happen, I was encouraging others to also explain this and I was speculating what could be learned from the block size war to prevent another war or in a worst case scenario what software could be run to ensure the activation attempt failed. Again all in public knowing that anything I said or any mistake I made would be carved in internet stone potentially for the rest of my life or longer. This wasn't my expertise at all although with a mathematical training and an earlier obsession with risk perhaps I was no less suited to the task than anyone else. The Bitcoin developer threatened to release software for an imminent activation attempt but at the last minute did not do so. To what extent this was due to my efforts I don't know. No one else publicly seemed to be taking it as seriously as I was. Not only would it have been a suboptimal addition to Bitcoin's consensus rules that it has to maintain for the rest of its lifetime and potentially another currency split like we saw with Bitcoin Cash it also would have opened the door to any number of new upgrades this particular developer thought should be added without getting community consensus first. Without agreement on Bitcoin's consensus rules or indeed any lack of certainty on what Bitcoin's consensus rules are Bitcoin can't function. If the network can't agree whether a transaction is valid or not it also can't agree on how many Bitcoin a particular address holds. Hence the bar on what upgrades are attempted has to be as high as you plausibly can make it. Otherwise Bitcoin is entering a game of Russian roulette with every bullet representing a new currency split.

What does all this have to do with the UK? If Bitcoin is routing around the UK and making the UK's financial system slowly obsolescent not much. In 6 years I was able to achieve very little in terms of building any kind of Bitcoin ecosystem from scratch. Of course I sacrificed vast swathes of time to do the cliched "right thing" for Bitcoin but as a one man band I wasn't going to achieve anything anyway. Post the activation struggles I was no longer being invited to Bitcoin Core in person meetings, I had a speaking slot cancelled at a Bitcoin conference, the primary Bitcoin development publication (Bitcoin Optech) stopped covering any of my work and popular Bitcoin podcasts wouldn't have me on. I had no reach in the global Bitcoin community let alone an ability to promote Bitcoin or Bitcoin opportunities within the UK. There were two kinds of people that did very well. In the developer community individuals who met the "diversity" requirements, were young, easily moulded and easily controlled were given everything: funding, work space, media reach, access to the most experienced developers and the freedom to do all their learning in private under the tutellage of those developers. Whilst I and some others tried to document everything we learned on public forums such as Bitcoin StackExchange these individuals left no learning trail whatsoever. It was if they had woken up one day and just uploaded the brains of those experienced developers. And no this is not possible in 2024 for the AGI science fiction writers. To state the obvious this was no longer a meritocracy although it initially started out that way. If you have near 24/7 access to the experienced developers, are allocated viable projects by those experienced developers, don't have to worry about funding, can hoard information and are on all the private chats you are not at the same starting line as someone who struggles to identify a viable project to work on, can't get those experienced developers to answer your questions, can't get funding and so has to do paid work outside of Bitcoin, seeks to publicly share any information you can get your hands on and are excluded from the private chats. Outside the developer community you had these individuals who came from nowhere, knew next to nothing about Bitcoin and would spout absolute nonsense but yet they'd get repeatedly invited to speak at all the conferences and all the podcasts. Some of them were wealthy which makes sense. Wealth attracts fawners for obvious reasons regardless of how that wealth was generated. But some weren't. I assume they were well connected with influential families or the mafia or something and perhaps the conventional media outside of Bitcoin works the same way. But after the first 5-6 years of Bitcoin's history when there was a meritocracy and anyone who showed up to a forum or the GitHub repository was treated the same as anyone else the meritocracy started crumbling. Unfortunately I missed those early years and hence in retrospect was fighting a losing battle from the start.

But there is enough out there publicly to start a company and try to create your own mini meritocracy from scratch. Large parts of the code are open source especially regarding the protocol which is much better than say Windows, MacOS, the Apple AppStore, the Twitter algorithm or the YouTube algorithm. You can't do it in the UK with the state seeking to squash any potential business model and any attempt to onboard users. But moving to or between expat communities is definitely a possibility and El Salvador seems to be the best candidate given the President, Nayib Bukele, has made Bitcoin legal tender and is seeking to build a Bitcoin ecosystem and support Bitcoin businesses. He has even introduced education initiatives so that El Salvador citizens can learn how Bitcoin works and encourage usage, the polar opposite to the approach in the UK which for a decade has misinformed and demonized Bitcoin in the media. Whilst small nation states like El Salvador and Israel persist and don't cave to the forces destroying large parts of the West there is still hope on this planet. But you have to go looking for it, it won't come to you.

## 31 Securing the Bitcoin foundation (2009-2017)

I only really got to observe the final years of the foundational Bitcoin years between 2009-2017. Of course there were decades of work and technical breakthroughs in fields such as cryptography and distributed systems prior to Bitcoin's release in 2009 and Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto was himself standing on the shoulders of giants. But with Satoshi exiting public involvement in Bitcoin in 2010 the task of securing Bitcoin's foundation was left to some of the smartest individuals I've met in my life and some of the smartest individuals I believe exist on the planet. For someone who had wallowed in the British state education system doing the bare minimum and still excelling by its own metrics the opportunity to observe some of these individuals and occasionally interacting with them was exhilarating. These were effectively Bitcoin's founding fathers and hopefully once Bitcoin's foundation is no longer at risk of being blown apart by consensus rule wars their efforts will be adequately documented and recognized. The block size war of 2015-2017 and the drive towards "diversity" ended this era although chinks of new consensus rule wars will unfortunately still present themselves in future. I'm not sure what lessons there are for say countries or aspiring businesses. Bitcoin's emergence has been unique and is unlikely to be repeated in our lifetimes. As a protocol and a consensus system that the entire network has to come to agreement on it is a totally different animal to say a business that can fail without posing existential risks to a country or the planet as a whole. There are similarities to internet protocols and I also see parallels with foundation building in a relatively new nation state like Israel. A nation state can't have multiple competing legal systems, parliaments or leaders. It can devolve some local decision making powers to smaller subentities but when it comes to is this nation state at war or not, what the borders of this nation state are and which justice system is recognized as the ultimate authority a monopoly is the only possible solution to stave off chaos. Maybe when I'm older and I've managed to turn my life around I'll look back with pride that I played a part in getting an important Bitcoin upgrade activated during Covid lockdowns without it descending into chaos afterwards. But it isn't what I set out to do from my suicidal post California slump in 2017 and it certainly wasn't without personal sacrifice.

## 32 Building other neutral, open source, censorship resistant base layers

Unfortuately other online platforms like video sharing (e.g. YouTube), search engines (e.g. Google), email (e.g. Gmail), social media (e.g. X, formerly Twitter), e-commerce (e.g. Amazon) and maps (e.g. Google Maps) don't share the same properties as Bitcoin's base layer. Bitcoin is open source, neutral and censorship resistant. While videos are taken down from YouTube and YouTube channels can be suspended or hidden from search results no one can steal your Bitcoin, no one can prevent your address from receiving Bitcoin and no one can stop your Bitcoin full node being discovered by other Bitcoin full nodes. The media has always tried to influence say election results. The newspaper in the UK, The Sun, famously published the front page headline in 1992 "If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?" with Kinnock's face in a light bulb. However that was nothing in comparison to what online platforms can do today. From their offices in California they can target specific individual floating voters with videos, articles or information personalized to cater to their fears or biases on election day. In the run up to the 2020 US election Twitter prevented Twitter users from sharing a New York Post article on Hunter Biden, President Biden's son, in supposedly private direct messages. Doing that for a US election is one thing, doing that for a foreign election is quite another. No serious independent country or democracy should want it subverted by the politics of California. But at least publicly no one seems to be doing anything. No one is demanding search algorithms are published or made open source and no one is demanding accountability, transparency and due process when say a YouTube channel is suspended or has its discoverability strangled. These platforms are rigged games and no one seems willing or capable to do anything about it. When before you'd go to a shop and decide whether you wanted to buy The Sun newspaper or not, today YouTube is the shop. Given its Californian politics it wouldn't even let you see The Sun as one of the available options which is quite the problem if it has a near monopoly on the shops.

The opportunity is to break open the YouTube and Google monopolies by building an alternative that is open source and transparent at its foundation. For a country like Israel which has been building technical competence in previous decades, has US senators like Chuck Schumer brazenly attempting to manipulate Israeli democracy by calling for new Israeli elections from the Senate floor (March 2024) and politics that generally operates to the right of the US spectrum and Californian spectrum it is a no brainer. Not only is it a commercial opportunity but it is a matter of national importance. Israel is by no means the only democracy that is nervously looking over its shoulder at how YouTube and Google are effectively national infrastructure at this point. Peter Thiel pointed out in 2014 (Zero to One) that Google had a search monopoly and was obscuring it by placing its business in the advertising industry rather than the internet search business. Ten years on nothing has changed other than Google putting its thumb on the scale with seemingly no restraint and much greater force. One response to this would be a Chinese style Great Firewall blocking citizens from accessing certain sites for every nation state that was concerned by this. As a believer in an open internet and free speech with a mistrust of the state I'd much rather see technologists solving these problems by offering the transparency and neutrality that YouTube and Google are unwilling to provide.

Although there are certainly lessons from Bitcoin's evolution on building other neutral, open source, censorship resistant base layers the problem of money has certain characteristics that other platforms don't have. Money requires a consensus system where everyone can ultimately agree on how much money every participant owns. Any monetary system where a subset of the network thinks Individual A owns X whilst another subset of the network thinks Individual A owns Y can't function. If you are a shop and Individual A wants to make a large purchase that costs Z which is greater than X but less than Y you are unsure whether Individual A has enough money to make that purchase or not. With video sharing, search engines, email etc there isn't this same problem. The vast majority of the network doesn't care what videos you own or have created, it doesn't care if one search engine provides different search results to another search engine and it doesn't care if an email between two individuals fails to reach its intended destination and gets returned to sender. Yet you only need one example of the network failing to agree on an individual's balance and that monetary system starts cracking from the inside. Hence other base layers are much more similar to Linux, the open source operating system competing with closed source operating systems like Windows and MacOS, than Bitcoin.

## 33 How to spawn more Linus Torvalds

If I was young today with what I now understand about software and technology I would pick whatever online platform was most exciting to me and learn absolutely everything I could about how that online platform works and try to build a rudimentary open source equivalent that my classmates or fellow students would be willing to use. Mark Zuckerberg initially built a site called FaceMash where you could rate the attractiveness of fellow students. Although you can certainly pick fault with the superficiality of the exercise was this really much different to the dating apps that appeared later like Tinder or Bumble? Without being open source these apps are now charging high fees to use a service where you have no understanding of what is happening under the hood. You have no idea how many people are viewing your profile, you have no idea how many people are rejecting you and for what reason and you have no idea whether what they are asking you to pay for the service is ultimately worth it or not. These companies are asking you to throw money into a black hole with no idea what you are getting in return for it. As a first iteration of dating apps perhaps they were groundbreaking but the user experience could be so much better than it is. For example imagine what data could be surfaced to the user when presented with a new profile. Firstly why are you seeing this profile? Is it because they are nearby, is it because they share interests with you, is it because you are well matched from a physical attractiveness perspective because similar numbers of people are swiping right on both of your profiles? You have no idea. The apps certainly for the less sought after profiles seem to be optimized for endlessly swiping without finding a match and despairingly throwing more coins into the Tinder wishing well. According to Quartz approximately 10 percent of males get 60 percent of all matches which just encourages male promiscuity and females being put off dating because they are treated as disposable by promiscuous men. So why isn't data on how many matches a particular profile gets surfaced to the user? A Warren Buffett like strategy for stock picking is finding companies that are undervalued rather than overvalued by the market. In the dating "market" you have no idea that a certain profile is being overlooked whilst another profile has too many matches than they know what to do with. Because everything under the hood is hidden and these companies are today prioritizing revenue growth rather than user experience vast swathes of their user base aren't getting what they want or could get out of it. New entrants with nothing to lose and a willingness to experiment with much greater levels of transparency and user feedback could very easily create a much better user experience. Why when you get a match and you agree to go on a date with that match are you not provided with recommendations or advertisements on where you could go in the local area and what you could do on that date? Why are the advertisements so useless? Ultimately it is because companies cling to their data and intellectual property and aren't prepared to open up the black box of their software to their users. You have to start small like Zuckerberg did on a college campus and do things that don't scale like Paul Graham suggested to hone the user experience in a tiny market but once you've managed to do that you can expand and end up offering a much better service than the revenue chasing incumbents are doing.

"The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them" Peter Thiel (Zero to One, 2014)

It is certainly possible that the next Linus Torvalds doesn't build an operating system. With Torvalds 54 years old in 2024 and continuing to maintain Linux, an open source operating system run on the majority of web servers and mobile devices, there doesn't seem to be a pressing need for a new open source operating system. Similarly with Bitcoin only 15 years old there isn't a pressing need for a new cryptocurrency and a new Satoshi Nakamoto (although with Satoshi exiting it still requires maintenance). But the early life of Torvalds does provide a template for taking your favorite closed source online platform and building something new with an open source foundation. Like most elite footballers Torvalds started young receiving one of the first ready made computers built for the home (Commodore VIC-20) at 11 years old. In 1981 the only thing you could do with it was program (in the BASIC programming language) and under his grandfather's tutellage that's where he started. He read the manuals and typed in the example programs which included simple games and bad graphics of a man walking across the screen. From this Torvalds started learning how the computer worked under the hood, programming in machine language rather than human readable language and getting "intimate with a machine" (Just For Fun, 2002). At 17 years old he was finding bugs in the operating system he was using and getting frustrated with how its code couldn't be changed, it was read only. As he moved from computer to computer and operating system to operating system it became clear that the sorts of things he wanted to do he couldn't because of the limitations of the operating system he was using. From this frustration he started on Linux which he described in a mailing list email as "just a hobby, won't be big and professional". The snowball had started and given anybody with a passing interest could review his code and suggest changes to it it gathered a momentum that more established and better funded, closed source operating systems couldn't compete with. Why stick with an operating system you can't change and is a black box when there is an operating system that has been designed from the ground up to be tweaked and altered by the user? Why let all your frustrations on how something works fester when there is an alternative world out there where you can build solutions to address those frustrations? The same logic applies to all your favorite online platforms today. The black box is trapping you in a web of bad or suboptimal outcomes.

In the world of atoms and certainly before the internet you would walk round town centers and depending on what you were seeking to purchase enter certain shops. The roads weren't controlled by any particular company and no company could hide the presence of certain physical shops. Compare that to using Amazon today. You visit the Amazon website, search for a particular item using a search algorithm that Amazon controls and isn't inspectable. Amazon controls which roads you go down and if it wants it can not surface details of a particular merchant that might be selling exactly the good you are looking for. This isn't to say Amazon wasn't groundbreaking or still isn't the most convenient way to find and purchase certain items today. But principles that would be unacceptable in the world of atoms (no one American company owns and controls a British town center for example) are the norm today in the world of bits. There is no transparency on what Amazon is doing behind the scenes and things that would be obvious in the world of atoms can be hidden in the world of bits. If you walked round your town center and every shop was a Amazon store at least you'd understand the reality of what was happening in your town center. On the Amazon site certain realities are obfuscated from you. In addition unlike physical shops in a town center Amazon pays very little tax in most of jurisdictions in which it operates and hence isn't operating on the same level playing field as physical shops. Rules that apply to the physical shops don't apply to Amazon. My point is not to suggest the world of bits should be ditched in favor of returning exclusively to the world of atoms although I do think the market is underestimating the role the world of atoms can play complementing the world of bits. My point is that effective national infrastructure being owned by a for profit American company with no transparency or accountability is untenable in the long term. A neutral, open source, censorship resistant base layer could let a fair market and ecosystem thrive on top of it rather than a for profit American company sucking all the value out the marketplace at the base.

## 34 The alternative future that never happened

Perhaps this is always the case with collapsing empires but surveying what could have been is a depressing exercise. There was a time when the UK stood for high levels of technical competence, innovation and showing the world what was possible. I started my professional career in the insurance market based in London within walking distance of Lloyd's of London. Initially set up in a coffee shop in the 1680s Lloyd's of London became the most innovative and exciting place in the world for pairing new sources of capital with insurance risks that conventional insurance companies didn't provide standardized products for. Individuals ("Lloyd's Names") could band together in a Lloyd's syndicate and negotiate the pricing of insurance policies for risks as unconventional and bespoke as maritime voyages, professional sports injuries or a singers' vocal cords. If you had a worry or a concern and wanted to financially protect yourself against the risk of that occurring Lloyd's of London was the first place you'd go on the entire planet. The internet and software presented an incredible opportunity to provide a Lloyd's of London experience to the world through a computer screen but it never happened. Instead the focus was on maintaining a history museum with routines like an individual in gowns hitting the Lutine Bell when a ship sank. Visit the Lloyd's of London website in 2024 and you'll see a timeline of when the first ethnic minorities were introduced and apologies for the slave trade in keeping with today's "diversity" dogma. It didn't have to be like this. The UK had the centuries old foundations to leverage its historic dominance in the world of atoms and build successful businesses and industries in the world of bits. But instead it surrendered to mediocrity, irrelevance and political correctness and it squandered all the work and invention of household names that built its reputation in the first place. With the exception of rare individuals who tried to fight the tide like Churchill and Thatcher the majority of those responsible for throwing away their inheritance and the work of their ancestors were rewarded for their appalling failures with titles, lordships and decorations. As Shimon Peres said "The past is dead, irrelevant. There is only the future". But the cautionary tale from the past doesn't half sting.

A competent, forward looking Lloyd's of London would be all over Bitcoin. Here is a new asset with unique characteristics and unique opportunies that weren't present with previous assets. The price fluctations in fiat terms aren't particularly interesting, every asset goes up and down in price based on market buying and selling although admittedly Bitcoin fluctuations are much more severe than say gold or blue chip stocks. But as an asset native to the internet and a programmable asset secured by digital cryptographic keys the risks and hence opportunities are vast. What device(s) should you store those cryptographic keys on? Can that manufacturer be trusted not to push a firmware update with an exploit in it? Should you use multisignature, a feature Bitcoin enables where the asset is secured by multiple cryptographic keys rather than just one? Who should securely store those keys and be relied upon to generate a digital signature when required? Do you seek to pass on your Bitcoin to your descendants and what particular multisignature scheme should you use so that your Bitcoin aren't stolen while you're alive but your descendants can still access them when you've passed away? There are risk questions all over the place and the Lloyd's of London from centuries ago would be champing at the bit to work out which risks were insurable and how to price those risks. The Lloyd's of London in 2024, crickets. Building competence and expertise in technical fields takes time. Although one can quibble over the exact number of hours required in each field Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hours rule adequately highlights the focus and dedication required to build the deep expertise required. This is nothing new though. Assessing the risks of a maritime voyage a century ago, evaluating which risks could be covered for a certain price and which should be excluded such that all eventualities were understood wasn't an overnight task either. Yet back then people had the dedication and the work ethic to attempt things that hadn't been done before and were financially rewarded for doing so. Today you'd spend years asking for permission from a bunch of overlapping regulatory agencies who had next to no expertise in the risk area you were seeking to expand into and seemingly motivated by the desire to keep all commercial activity within the constraints of their limited spheres of expertise. With this approach Lloyd's of London would have never expanded out of the coffee shop. But Bitcoin is only one example. With the technology  and data available today both applied to the world of atoms as well as the world of bits it is possible to price and ultimately insure risks that wouldn't have been possible decades let alone centuries ago. Every single action or decision in one's life contains risk. Wherever there is risk there is a potential insurance opportunity.  

## 35 Let's assign victimhood status

Of course there are no such apologies on racism or mistreatment of Jews in today's "diversity" dogma and on today's websites. No apologies for excluding Jews from England for three and a half centuries before they were readmitted in 1656. No apologies for excluding Jews from Parliament, local government and universities until the 19th century. No apologies on German websites for confining Jews to particular ghettoes such as the Judengasse in Frankfurt and being barred from entering parks and coffee houses, obliged to wear Jewish insignia by law until 1726. Although the effects of Nazism and the Holocaust still impact the German national psyche today you aren't met by apologies for the Holocaust when you visit a website for a German financial institution in 2024. The "diversity" dogma picks and chooses who it wants to portray as historical victims and who it wants to portray as historical oppressors and what you are left with is an inconsistent sham that the state and the media are determined to perpetuate. And yet from within the high walls of the impoverished Judengasse ghetto in Frankfurt was where the Rothschild banking dynasty emerged in the 18th century. Initially an antiques and coin dealer Mayer Amschel Rothschild only moved into providing banking services in the late 1790s (House of Rothschild, Niall Ferguson). With the British Industrial Revolution beginning to whir overseas demand for the cheaper and higher quality British cloths presented an opportunity for German businessmen like Rothschild to import them and sell them in domestic markets. His son Nathan emigrated to England with some startup capital from his father and established a base there. A natural progression from selling textiles was to offer credit terms to customers and from there Nathan's focus increasingly became this lending part of the business and negotiating with London bankers for access to greater amounts of capital. Both Nathan and his father shifted from being mere merchants to being merchant bankers in a broadly unregulated market. When trying to extrapolate where Bitcoin goes from here in 2024 it seems the 19th century is a much more relevant era of history than the 20th. The gold rush in California and the gold standard used by central banks emerged in the 19th century so if Bitcoin is truly "digital gold" and there is to be an emergence of a digital gold standard knowledge of how a 20th or 21st century financial system operates is almost irrelevant. In 2024 no currencies have been issued linked to Bitcoin and no lending markets denominated in Bitcoin have gained serious traction. With the huge fluctuations in the Bitcoin price today you'd probably need the price to stabilize somewhat so that it behaves like the gold price before a Bitcoin standard could truly emerge. In 2024 we're probably still in the (digital) gold rush part of the life cycle. But where the Nathan Rothschilds emigrate to build banking businesses in this potential new world isn't clear. There would be a certain symmetry if it ended up being Israel and a street off Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv.

"Your life is not f\*\*\*ed up because of overt racists or hidden systemic racism. You aren't missing out on opportunities, making s\*\*\* money and getting evicted because of America or Donald f\*\*\*ing Trump or because your ancestors were slaves or because some people hate immigrants or Jews or harrass women or believe gay people are going to hell. If any of that s\*\*\* is stopping you from excelling in life I've got some news. You are stopping you." David Goggins

What did Nathan Rothschild not do upon showing up in England? He didn't demand that he be given a job at a large business or in government due to his ethnicity and how badly his ancestors had been treated in Germany. He didn't start a "Jewish Lives Matter" organization on the back of a Jew dying abroad guilt tripping businesses into donating to it when they had nothing to do with that individual's death. He didn't demand reparations for Jews being excluded from England for three and a half centuries. In short he didn't perceive himself as a victim and didn't want to project victimhood in his early business dealings. The rot in a country begins when competition over skills, products and services becomes a race to the bottom on who the greater victim is perceived to be. The jury is still out on how effective multicultural societies can be but if one culture is forced to give money and jobs to another culture purely because that culture is assigned victimhood status that multicultural society cannot function and it certainly cannot compete with societies that are focusing entirely on the real competition. Now Jews have a Jewish nation state they have the same option other ethnicities and other religions have always had. If you don't want to be a ethnic minority and compete with the ethnic majority go to a country where you are part of the ethnic majority. Other ethnicities have far more options than the Jews' single option and yet many begrudge the Jews having that option whilst simultaneously taking advantage of victimhood schemes in their new country of residence. 

## 36 Tapping into the David Goggins 40 percent rule

Prioritizing what to focus on in life is arguably the greatest challenge. Rabbi Manis Friedman uses the parable of the man who sets sail to make his fortune only to find himself shipwrecked on an island that is covered in diamonds. On speaking to the locals he learns that the diamonds are perceived as worthless on this island and instead they use scarce onions as currency. Hence he works hard to earn as many onions as he can to earn a living on the island. When he finally leaves the island to return home he loads the ship up with all his onions. On arriving back home his family is disgusted by his cargo of rotting onions. Other than perhaps the parallel of Bitcoin versus inflating fiat currencies the greater parallel is how a cargo of financial wealth is worth nothing after death. Hence our minds or our souls are torn between often competing objectives of succeeding in capitalism and attempting tasks to assist others that don't accrue financial rewards. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates formed The Giving Pledge in 2010 to contribute the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes so that they don't die with a cargo of rotting onions. But I suspect the majority of this allocation was completed decades after their peak of competence when Buffett was building Berkshire Hathaway and Gates was building Microsoft. So did they make a mistake? Should they have spent more time when they were younger allocating capital to philanthropic causes or would that have drastically reduced the success of Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft? Did they spend too much time amassing onions and not enough time amassing diamonds when they were at the peak of their cerebral powers? Were the onions converted into diamonds too late and ultimately wasted? These are tough questions with no easy answers. But whatever currency you are seeking to amass very few reach the levels of performance that Buffett and Gates did and a world with more Buffetts and Gates would surely offer more diamond conversion opportunties. David Goggins hasn't amassed the financial wealth that Buffett and Gates have. His net worth in 2024 according to various sources is in the single millions of dollars rather than the billions. But you certainly couldn't claim his achievements and his impact on the world is a miniscule fraction of various billionaires.

Goggins believes the vast majority of humans today are operating at about 40 percent of their ultimate capabilities. Through studying his mind and its response to being pushed so much further than it was willing to go he found that he was able to complete ultramarathons with all kinds of injuries including at one point a broken leg. Although it probably isn't advisable to go to the lengths that Goggins has he has been able to demonstrate that most of us are leaving a large percentage of our capabilities on the table. We listen to our minds when it says we are at maximum effort when in reality our minds are lying to us. The pursuit of maximizing one's potential never ends and although Goggins is well past his physical peak at approaching 50 years old he still completes ultramarathons and pursues new challenges that people half his age would cower from. He named his second book "Never Finished". With approximately 40 percent of the world's Jewish population residing in Israel in 2024 the project of Jewish revival is far from finished and there is still a large part of Jewish capability left untapped.

## 37 Aliyah and the ascent to Jerusalem

"The message of the Torah is that you never arrive. It is more about the journey than the destination." Rabbi Shlomo Einhorn

Aliyah (עלייה) translates to ascent in Hebrew. It is also the word used for when Jews return to Israel. The Law of Return was passed unanimously by the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, on July 5th 1950 (re-)granting Jews the right to Israeli citizenship. For century upon century Jews have ended the Passover (Pesach) holiday with a wish that "Next year in Jerusalem". A holiday celebrating Jewish households being passed over by a plague prior to Moses leading an exodus from Egypt to the Promised Land. So in 2024 and with Jerusalem back under Jewish control what is stopping "**This** year in Jerusalem" and permanently? Israel's first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion worried that Jews wouldn't return in the formative years of the modern day nation state due to existential wars, a weak military and a lack of basic infrastructure. Although those worries were assuaged during Ben-Gurion's lifetime today the sacrifices required to give up Western safety and comforts are vanishingly small. Israel's missile defense system (Iron Dome and David's Sling) is state of the art. Israel's military (Israel Defense Forces) and intelligence services (Mossad) would be ranked near the top of global rankings. Infrastructure for water, electricity, transport, internet and healthcare is globally competitive. Learning the national language (Hebrew), committing yourself and/or your descendants to military service and accepting a somewhat higher terrorism risk (though vastly reduced from previous decades) would probably be the biggest sticking points. Reading how military service laid the lifestyle foundations for David Goggins and fellow retired US Navy Seal Jocko Willink certainly makes one more amenable to the idea of military service especially when I think back to what I was doing and the time I was wasting at military service age. However, the higher risk of death and/or disability in active military engagements is real especially in the Middle East. Hence those with no ties or connection to their Jewish identity and no desire to participate in the Jewish story may not be convinced.

"G*d has entered into a special relationship or covenant with one people, the Jews or Israel, and given them the task of being a light to the nations" Carl Ehrlich

The opportunity for a nation state roughly 1/500th the size of the US or China with one of the world's smallest yet oldest ethnicities and religions is to be this "light to the nations" especially given how the Torah and the lands of Israel laid the foundations for much more widespread and disseminated religions such as Christianity and Islam. It is understandable that after a long history of pogroms, the Holocaust and Islamic terrorism that the Jewish people would settle for a mere sanctuary but the leaders of the Zionist movement have certainly set their sights higher than that. Whether it be Theodor Herzl's "If you will it, it is no dream", David Ben-Gurion's "In Israel, in order to be a realist, you must believe in miracles" or Shimon Peres' "You're as young as your dreams, not as old as your calendar" the philosophical and spiritual undercurrent has continuously grasped for the impossible even as the real world emergencies mounted up. There is a necessity for outperformance at a small scale because it is the only way to maintain relevance in a world of giants. You also see this dynamic in technology startup ecosystems such as Silicon Valley where crazily ambitious ideas attract talented people much more effectively than merely practical ambitious ideas. Whatever drove it Jewish culture and customs refused to die or wither away in the scattered diaspora despite centuries of persecution and pressure to assimilate. Now it is reassembling under its own roof again it has the chance to demonstrate why it was so important it didn't.

## 38 Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Land)

"When I think of my son's future I ask myself whether I have the right to make life so difficult for him as it has become for me" Theodor Herzl

One of the many miracles in the resurrection of Israel was how despite little precedent to follow and with a multitude of strong opposing views on how to achieve it the essential building blocks of that nation state were assembled and refined such that it is difficult for a mere mortal to find flaws with the end result. Of course this didn't happen in the absence of sustained and near obsessive human endeavor. If history had turned out differently and indeed if an uncertain Herzl had got his way the only Jewish state could today be in Uganda or Argentina rather than the lands of his biblical ancestors. This attempt at a compromise or an intended halfway house would have resulted in a flawed first building block. Without land a nation state is nothing and with the wrong land it would have been difficult to self correct at a later time. The arguments and motivation for a state in the Middle East would have been weakened and the intended halfway house could very well have ended up being the final house and ultimate dead end. Succeed with the ill fated project and there's no need to embark on a follow up project. Fail with the ill fated project and why wouldn't this be harbinger of what would happen in the follow up project? Though Herzl had good intentions and wanted a viable sanctuary from persecution for Jewish people as early as he could achieve it he and his future nation state dodged a bullet by not compromising on that first building block. Despite uncertainty over the exact borders on formation a foothold in Jerusalem was ultimately established and without it Herzl would have at best been assigned to the footnotes of history.         

## 39 Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Language)

"If we wish that the name Israel be not extinguished, then we are in duty bound to create something which may serve as a center for our entire people, like the heart in an organism, from which the blood will stream into all the arteries of the national body and fill it with life." Eliezer Ben-Yehuda

The next building block after determining the lands of the nation state were to assign a language in which its citizens would communicate. The Herzl of the language question was Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. While Herzl didn't think Hebrew would be a viable option given it hadn't been a spoken language for 1,500 years Ben-Yehuda thought otherwise and was determined to revive the biblical language as Israel's national language. This required inventing new Hebrew words for objects such as newspaper and dictionary that hadn't existed 1,500 years prior. For greater legitimacy or merely due to reverence for the past Ben-Yehuda rooted many of these new words in existing Hebrew words. The Hebrew for time (et, עֵת) rooted iton (עִתּוֹן) for newspaper since a newspaper is a time sensitive publication. The Hebrew for word (milah, מִלָה) rooted milon (מִלּוֹן) for dictionary since a dictionary is a collection of words (The 700 Club). Ben-Yehuda himself started a weekly newspaper in Hebrew and completed six volumes of a Hebrew dictionary during his lifetime. In addition to updating the language for the modern day Ben-Yehuda raised the first native speaker of Hebrew in modern times, his son Itamar. At a time when mixing with other children would have meant exposure to languages other than Hebrew Ben-Yehuda kept his son at home so that he would only learn Hebrew words, including words he himself had invented, and would only converse in Hebrew. This led to his son only speaking his first word at the age of four, reportedly the Hebrew word for enough (dey, דֵּי) as his father was berating his mother for singing a lullaby in Russian.

## 40 Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Flag)

"We have no flag, and we need one. If we desire to lead many men, we must raise a symbol above their heads." Theodor Herzl

There was no flag (degel, דֶּגֶל) to inherit from the times before Jerusalem was seized by the Romans two millennia ago and in the centuries since the design and pronouncement of a unique, recognizable flag had become a rite of passage for any new nation state. Herzl himself suggested a white flag with a star in the center but a gold star rather than a blue one. The color of the Star of David (Magen David, מגן דוד) at the center of the Israeli flag was ultimately chosen to be the shade of blue used by the Tallit (טַלִּית), the traditional Jewish prayer shawl. The Star of David itself is made up of two triangles. The triangle's three corners represent the relationship between G\*d, Israel and the Torah with the triangle pointing upwards representing people working for G\*d and the triangle pointing downwards representing G\*d working for the people. The blue stripes at the top and bottom of the flag also mirror those on the Tallit. The second President of the Zionist Organization David Wolffsohn stated "Let us take this Tallit from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations".

## 41 Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Government)

There was a representative assembly 1,500 years ago called the Great Assembly (Knesset Hagedolah, כְּנֶסֶת הַגְּדוֹלָה) with 120 members made up of rabbis and prophets. The government that was formed with the modern day state of Israel inherited the name ("Knesset", כְּנֶסֶת) and the number of representatives (Members of Knesset or MKs) but it also installed selective pillars of 20th century democratic systems seen in the UK, US and Europe. The head of state, the President, is elected by secret ballot in the Knesset but carries out a more ceremonial role than say the US President with similar powers and responsibilities to a British monarch. The executive power is vested in the Prime Minister, the head of government, who is nominated by the President but can only form a government with the support of a majority of MKs. The MKs themselves represent political parties that received a sufficient number of votes in national elections to be represented in the Knesset. In this sense each MK does not represent a particular region of Israel in the same way as British MPs represent a certain constituency in the UK or Senators and Members of Congress represent a certain state or district in the US. With the uncertainty over the exact borders of the nation state on formation and Israel's small size in land mass this representation of political parties rather than regions avoided the inevitable disruption caused by wars and malleable borders without the need to suspend or repeatedly revamp the election process. The proportional representation of Israel's democracy and need to enter into coalitions between political parties to form a government more closely resembles many European systems than the UK's or US' first-past-the-post systems. It is also said that this system allows minority interests to be represented in coalition governments rather than one of two major political parties inevitably forming the next government. With Jewish diaspora returning to Israel over time with very different experiences and perspectives the ability for new political parties to participate and potentially be represented in the Knesset makes the system adaptable to Israel's continuously evolving population.

One inevitable point of contention was the extent to which G\*d and the Jewish religion would be infused into the Jewish state's newly formed Knesset. The precedent from other democratic systems was as Thomas Jefferson put it "building a wall of separation between church and State". The rationale for this separation was to enshrine freedom of religion into the U.S. Constitution and to avoid heated theological debates subsuming the advancement and refinement of the nation's laws and regulations. Indeed Israel's Declaration of Independence (1948) guarantees freedom of religion within the Jewish State noting how Israel contains holy places for religions other than Judaism and a significant Arab population practising a different religion. Ultimately this declaration did not mention G\*d by name at all with some of its signatories and indeed Herzl himself identifying as secular though a reverential reference to the "rock of Israel" did make it into the final document prior to the signatures. Instead like the Israeli flag the religious signatories had to settle for infused imagery with the Menorah being chosen as the emblem of the Knesset and the seating of the plenum hall where Members of Knesset sit being arranged in the shape of a menorah. The Menorah, a seven branch candelabrum, represents the eternal light and presence of G*d as described in the Hebrew Bible. It also resembles a tree with seven branches just as the Torah is referred to as the "Tree of Life" (עץ החיים).

One indisputable flaw with Israel's Declaration of Independence was including the declaration that a constitution would be adopted later in the year (October 1948) only for that objective to be postponed indefinitely in 1950 at least partly due to disagreements at a time of war. To this day Israel has no formal constitution to parallel the U.S. Constitution. Instead it has what is referred to as Basic Laws which some consider the state's constitution although a new Basic Law was introduced as late as 2018 with the Basic Law: Israel - The Nation State of the Jewish People. With no formal constitution, no second chamber like the US Senate or the House of Lords in the UK, no restrictions on striking down laws and limited ability for the elected Knesset to reform or restructure it the Supreme Court in Israel is one of the most powerful Supreme Courts in the world. The Netanyahu government attempted judicial reform in 2023 to restrict the Supreme Court's power to strike down legislation passed by the elected Knesset but as of 2024 the Supreme Court has struck down that particular legislation. This tension between the elected Knesset and the seemingly more powerful, unelected Supreme Court will almost certainly prove to be a continuing growing pain for Israeli democracy without reform bringing it line with other democratic systems. As of 2024 the focus has turned to military action in Gaza and elsewhere but this problem will no doubt rear its head repeatedly in future especially if the Supreme Court continues to strike down legislation intending to rebalance powers back to Israel's democratically elected chamber.

## 42 Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Military)

"Perhaps we are all Aladdins, every novel idea is a kind of magic lamp able to bring forth the creative spirit... till it becomes obsolete. Perhaps herein lies the real achievement of victory when the victor becomes dispensable." Ze'ev Jabotinsky

Every nation state needs an organized, cohesive and united military and Israel critically needed one immediately on conception. No sooner had David Ben-Gurion declared independence and the British Mandate been terminated than the concept of a Jewish state was under attack by surrounding Arab states. Hence somehow Ben-Gurion had to conjure a military into being to defend it overnight which is of course impossible. Instead the ground work was laid in the previous decades to cobble together a fighting force that could unite against a common enemy seeking to asphyxiate it from birth. The Herzl of the defense question was (arguably, in a military context where the focus is less on particular individuals) Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Jabotinsky is considered by many as Herzl's successor in advancing the Zionist cause and the implementer of Herzl's vision. Hence focusing exclusively on his role setting up early defense organizations is ignoring the multitude of contributions elsewhere within the Revisionist Zionism movement he founded and led. One could go further and claim he birthed the right wing political movement in Israel which spawned multiple future Prime Ministers and multiple political parties including the current Prime Minister (Netanyahu) and the current largest political party (Likud). But without resolving the defense question there wouldn't have been a Jewish state to govern so it is not unreasonable to claim this was his most significant achievement.

The constantly shifting geopolitical terrain in the decades preceding Israel's Declaration of Independence in 1948 complicated Jabotinsky's task yet further. Two world wars, a still immensely powerful British Empire that seemed to oscillate from supporting the Zionist cause to opposing it and internal divisions on the optimal path to take with no democratic mandate to resolve those divisions required high levels of both steadfastness and flexibility. At times Jewish battalions in the Jewish Legion were fighting with and sometimes within the British Army such as in World War 1. But when British sentiment turned against Jewish migration and settlement in Israel Jabotinsky and the military organizations he had helped set up held no qualms reversing course and executing a strategy of armed revolt against the British. Facilitating Jewish migration from Nazi Germany in the run up to World War 2 was literally a life or death issue for huge swathes of Jewish people ignoring the ultimate fate of a future Jewish state. Hence unravelling the threads of perfidy between the British and the Jews at this time is complex. It is unquestionable that the diplomatic sands were continuously shifting as power over British foreign policy flowed back and forth from Zionist allies such as Lord Balfour and Sir Winston Churchill to Zionist adversaries such as Neville Chamberlain and the author of the 1939 White Paper restricting Jewish immigration, Malcolm MacDonald. In this climate Jabotinsky had no choice but to follow the John Maynard Keynes maxim "When the facts change I change my mind. What do you do sir?"

That a Jewish Legion was formed at all to hone valuable experience fighting in World War 1 was broadly down to Jabotinsky's diplomatic efforts against resistance from both Zionist leaders and skepticism amongst the British. Jabotinsky himself enlisted as a private before being promoted to lieutenant within the 3 Jewish battalions that became known as "The First Judeans". After being demobilized for what Jabotinsky considered political reasons he settled in Jerusalem in 1920 where he formed the first self defense unit in the country, Ha'haganah (The Defense, הַהֲגָנָה). This endeavor also landed him in trouble with the British authorities as he was arrested during disturbances and condemned to 15 years hard labor, later reduced to 1 year's imprisonment. From this organization more radical offshoots such as Etzel (or Irgun) and Lehi branched off and they sought to drive the British out of Israel during and after World War 2 through much more violent means. Shortly after the Declaration of Independence Ben-Gurion was able to form the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) by merging these at times very different paramilitary organizations into a single national army. Like Herzl before him Jabotinsky did not live to see it, passing away near New York in 1940 whilst campaigning for the creation of a Jewish Army. He was eventually reburied on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem nearby to Herzl himself who he had first defended in a speech at a Zionist Congress in 1903.          

"The IDF is thus the child and successor of the Haganah. The seed that was planted many decades previously in the first settlements, had sprouted into a sturdy oak, struggling hard in order to grow and develop, but finally overcoming all its problems. If the Haganah is the trunk of this tree, then the IDF is the mesh of sturdy branches that sprang from it and drew on its sap - branches that shelter and protect all that grows in their shade throughout the State of Israel." Ha'hagana (Adapted from a Brief History of the Haganah)

## 43 Religious Zionism - Revising Revisionist Zionism?

"A person lacking it (religion) is not a harmonious human being... I am not certain that we shall be able to bring about a revival. Perhaps it is a quality with which one is born, bestowed upon the few, something like musical talent. But if it were possible to create a generation of believers, I would be happy." Ze'ev Jabotinsky

Nothing in the natural world stands still. The world constantly evolves and at the very least one is forced to react to external changes. Leaders like Herzl and Jabotinsky were able to shape the future of Israel and identify its future needs decades previous. Jabotinsky's Revisionist Zionism took Herzl's Zionism and updated it to emphasize the importance of a strong military, of not relying exclusively on diplomacy with often fickle allies, of building a nation state that would eventually attract the entire diaspora and inspire the world through quotes such as "For out of Zion shall go forth the Law" (Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Joseph Nedava). On religion Jabotinsky was admiring though not strictly observant himself. His childhood home was filled with Jewish tradition and his mother Hasidic but he became apathetic to Jewish customs and rituals as he witnessed the way Jews apologetically assimilated into their host countries, accepted their plight in the degradation of slums and adopted "servile humor, which papers over the abasement by belittling the hated tyrant instead of rising up in revolt". He maintained deference to his religion throughout his life though never advocated for religious coercion.

To propel Israel further into the 21st century it could be argued that it is missing the overarching political movements and philosophies that Herzl and Jabotinsky formulated and propagated. One candidate for such a movement would be Religious Zionism. Today it is perhaps most strongly represented by the political parties Religious Zionism led by Bezalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) led by Itamar Ben-Gvir with roots in the ideology of Rabbi Meir Kahane who was assassinated in New York in 1990 by a suspected Islamic terrorist. Kahane was infuriated by the way Jews almost by habit after centuries in the diaspora took their apologism and servile attitude to Israel when they finally had the chance to rebuild their national home. He looked on in horror as Israeli leadership rewarded Islamic terrorism by repeatedly agreeing to give away its biblical heartlands and shrink an already tiny country. With the Americans taking the place of the British as the global hegemon in the second half of the 20th century Israel was pressured to countenance splitting Jerusalem into two and continues to this day to restrict Israeli citizens' access to Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism, as if Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is still a temporary façade. Kahane saw this American approach towards Israel as ultimately hypocritical, kowtowing to violence and Arab financial interests and displaying the same fickleness as the British before them. The Americans would never agree to relinquish southern states to Mexico for example in the hypothetical scenario where Mexico funded and orchestrated a campaign of terror against the US. If anything Kahane saw Israel's historic claims over its lands as stronger than American historic claims over its own lands. During Kahane's lifetime his views were extremely controversial and his Kach political party was banned from participating in the 1988 elections for the Knesset. In 2024 his views seem to have permeated the Israeli mainstream as leaders such as Smotrich and Ben-Gvir gain in popularity and Israeli society seems to have come to the realization that sovereignty within a country's borders is not a granular thing. It is binary. You either have it or you don't.                                              

## 44 The Third Temple - Where the wailing stops

"The mountain of G\*d's house shall be established atop the mountains... all the nations shall flow unto it" Isaiah 2:2

The Western Wall (the Kotel, הַכּוֹתֶל) or Wailing Wall is the wall within the Old City of Jerusalem where Jews pray and mourn the loss of the Second Temple, destroyed during the Roman siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. It is also where slips of paper containing written prayers are placed within the cracks of the wall. The original First Temple had been built by King Solomon, son of King David, in 966 BCE and was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple Jews have been without a place of worship on their holiest site. The project to restore the Holy Temple hence is much anticipated and artifacts such as a golden Menorah, an altar, musical instruments and priestly garments have already been painstakingly prepared to meet the exact specifications as described in Jewish religious texts. Precise plans have also been drawn up for the various chambers, gates and courtyards (The Holy Temple in Jerusalem, Rabbi Yisrael Ariel). What is holding up the commencement of construction work especially with Jerusalem back under Jewish control is primarily politics and the security situation. Itamar Ben-Gvir has called for Jews to pray on the Temple Mount despite status quo conventions restricting it and has personally visited the site himself on numerous occasions receiving backlash from media outlets, Palestinian groups such as Hamas and Arab states in the region. To what extent he and others in a broader Religious Zionism movement can make this a key pillar of future election campaigns may ultimately determine whether construction of a Third Temple can begin in this generation or whether future generations will be left to pick up the mantle.

"And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them" Exodus 25:8

There is a messianic ethos running through Judaism where preparing for and hastening the coming of Moshiach (מָשִׁיחַ) is a key motivator for keeping commandments (mitzvot, מצוות) and for building a better future. It is such ingrained in Jewish tradition that spiritual leaders implore political leaders to work harder and do more to usher in this age sooner. During his lifetime "The Rebbe" (The Lubavitcher Rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson) met with Netanyahu on multiple occasions repeatedly enquiring why the Moshiach hadn't arrived yet. Many Jews have set aside clothes to wear on the day that this occurs. A common reason used to justify __not__ doing things such as founding and returning to the modern day nation state of Israel or building the Third Temple is that they should only be completed once Moshiach has arrived. This uncertainty and tension over what humans should attempt to accomplish through their own agency and what should be left to G\*d's will is nothing new. The parable of the drowning man portrays the essence of this age-old quandary where a religious man drowning in an ocean refuses to accept assistance offered by multiple boats because he is convinced G\*d will save him. After perishing in the ocean the man asks G\*d why he didn't intervene to which G\*d responds that he had sent the boats who had come to the man's aid. Just as The Star of David has a triangle pointing upwards representing people working for G\*d sometimes the tools for completing a task have been laid in front of man and yet man still waits for G\*d to accomplish it.

## 45 Refocusing on the lodestar

Whatever the level of abstraction, whether it be at the level of the individual, family, community, country or people, it is difficult for them to function let alone thrive without a lodestar. A lodestar is defined as a star used in navigation or astronomy as a point of reference or something that serves as a guide or model (British Dictionary). The Jewish people are blessed (or cursed depending on your perspective) that after two millennia on the run their lodestar is blatantly obvious. The restoration of the Jewish state, the restoration of Jerusalem and ultimately the restoration of the Holy Temple. In contrast it is not clear what the lodestar is for the Christian people or gentiles in 2024. The concern is that certainly the British Empire and maybe even the American one has seen its best days and what follows is just a question over the speed of decline. If one had to choose one would be rather on the slope upwards rather than the slope downwards reminiscing over the good ol' days. But no people would choose to wallow in the wilderness fleeing repeated persecutions and pogroms for two millennia to earn a lodestar. The challenge for the Christian people or gentiles will be to carve out small states like Israel in their old empires with clear lodestars that their people and their descendants are willing to dedicate their lives to and ultimately willing to die for. The alternative if they fail is to have the historical Jewish experience of wandering from place to place for centuries as a persecuted minority and subsumed into Islamic societies and traditions. The irony is that with much of the Western world demonizing Israel it is providing the template for survival and G*d willing the template for thriving in a new world with the old economies of scale breaking down and the world of bits bypassing the world of atoms.

The Hebrew word for sin (חטא) means something akin to a missed opportunity, like an arrow missing its mark (chabad.org). The archery or dart board that presents itself to each generation is different. The board that presented itself to Theodor Herzl was different to the board that presented itself to Ze'ev Jabotinsky as was the board that initially presented itself to Benjamin Netanyahu. A bullseye in Herzl's time represented a different set of objectives and overcoming a different set of challenges to a bullseye in Netanyahu's time. Maimonides ("The Rambam"), the 12th century rabbi who compiled a list of the 613 commandments (mitzvot, מצוות), described the rebuilding of the Holy Temple as a mitzvah that is "binding for all generations". He believed that sacrifices should be offered on the altar there even while the Temple is not built. In recent centuries it is a common belief that each generation in which the Temple isn't rebuilt it is as if that generation destroyed it. Maimonides also stated in his rulings that performing the commandments should not be dependent on the coming of Moshiach (מָשִׁיחַ) and that they should be performed to the best of abilities under all conditions. The coming of Moshiach is left to G*d but earthly commandments are within man's purview.

## 46 Yes we Kahane

"You need this land and it needs you, many of you. Millions of new Jews pouring into Israel will fill up its empty spaces, guarantee the retention of all the liberated lands of Judea, Samaria, Golan, Gaza, and Sinai; assure a vast Jewish majority despite the addition of a million new non-Jews; add Western democratic and technical skills to the land. Eretz Yisrael will never again be lost to us." Rabbi Meir Kahane

In the world of bits bits have been known to have flipped due to reasons as obscure as cosmic rays. Through no fault of the engineers of the software or the hardware it is possible (though admittedly highly unlikely) that data can be corrupted or servers can crash due to this reason. It highlights why the lower the level engineers are operating at the more fastidious they need to be as the tiniest, most minute error can be devastating. It is difficult to maximize one's fastidiousness if one is regularly distracted or worse dodging bullets and rockets. In the world of atoms rebuilding the Third Temple requires similar levels of fastidiousness if one is to follow the exact specifications as described in Jewish religious texts. Whether it be a perfectly unblemished, ritually pure red heifer or an altar built to match the dimensions of the altar built by Moses in the desert they seem to test the limits of human fastidiousness. The environment in which it is possible to achieve this can only be created by the militarial and security efforts nominally led by Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir. It doesn't matter how unblemished your red heifer is if it can be bombed by a terrorist or if the Temple Mount can be flattened by a nuclear bomb at any moment. With regards to the Third Temple it seems that Netanyahu will ultimately be judged on how he dealt with the nuclear threat and Ben-Gvir to what he extent he was able to secure the Temple Mount to create the conditions in which rebuilding the Third Temple became possible. Meanwhile the words of Rabbi Meir Kahane live on decades after his death imploring Israel's leaders to address Israel's security challenges and enforce its sovereignty over its lands.

"The Moslems and the mosques shall be removed from the holiest site in Judaism, the Temple Mount, and the disgrace of desecration of Judaism ended. Consider the reaction of Moslems - and rightly so - to a Jewish synagogue on the holy Moslem site in Mecca! And yet Jews sit and enforce the abomination of Moslem rule and prohibition of Jewish presence on the Temple Mount!" Rabbi Meir Kahane

The accusation of racism was weaponized against Kahane during his lifetime. His Kach political party was banned in 1988 under revised election laws related to the incitement of racism and he suffered a similar fate to those "canceled" in recent times unable to appear on mainstream television programs with his press conferences and statements not reported on by the Israeli media. Baking a blatant asymmetry into the "status quo" where other races and faiths were treated as dominant and superior to Kahane's Judaism in the supposedly only Jewish state incensed Kahane. To Kahane the "status quo" that restricted Jews' rights to access and pray on the Temple Mount was symbolic of the bankruptcy of Jewish leadership that was willing to trade and compromise away some of the most cherished aspects of the Zionist dream for political and diplomatic convenience. He was highlighting blatant absurdities decades before it was acceptable to in mainstream Israeli politics. Today Kahanists like Ben-Gvir have broken through and seem to have sufficient escape velocity so as not to suppressed and put back in the bottle by an at times self interested and directionless Jewish establishment. Whether individuals like Ben-Gvir have the courage of Kahane and are willing to keep pushing against the hypocrisies and asymmetries at possible personal cost politically will determine whether the flywheel started by Kahane maintains its momentum or stalls. Kahane paid the ultimate price with his life and in this game of high stakes poker political fortunes can certainly be won or lost.

"I've made my living Mr Thompson in large part as a gambler. Some days I make twenty bets. Some days I make none. There are weeks, sometimes months in fact, when I don't make a bet at all because there simply is no play. So I wait. Plan. Marshall my resources. And when I finally see an opportunity and there is a bet to make? I bet it all." Arnold Rothstein character in Boardwalk Empire (HBO)

There will come a time, perhaps in the run up to an election season, when Ben-Gvir will be faced with two options. Stick rigidly to his Kahanist belief system which ultimately is just a Torah based belief system, Kahane was "totally immersed in Torah during his lifetime" and his "strength derived from this" (Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu, former Chief Rabbi of Israel). Or water it down and compromise on it in an attempt to gain votes and become more palatable to an international audience. Kahane was clear in his belief that Israel should be set apart from the rest of the nations, a principle established in the verse "It is a nation dwelling alone" (Num 23:9). He believed that G\*d wished Israel to be set apart from the non-Jew and wished the land to be free of their influence. In addition Kahane considered living in Israel as a mitzvah commanded by the Torah itself and indeed a mitzvah that carried equal weight to all the other mitzvot combined. An Israel controlled by Jews in the diaspora who refused to live in Israel and follow this critical commandment was also an anathema to him. This would be a significant step change from the status quo. Netanyahu, arguably wisely during his time, was and continues to be strongly oriented towards the United States like most other Western allies in the 20th and 21st century. But under Democratic leadership American meddling in Israeli affairs to the detriment of Israeli military objectives has led Ben-Gvir to state "I really admire the United States of America but with all due respect we are not another star in the American flag". The Israel that Kahane envisaged, and one suspects the Israel that Ben-Gvir would like to mold has little room for compromise and watering down whether it be land, sovereignty or ultimately progress towards a Third Temple. At some point Ben-Gvir will inevitably have to decide whether he's all in on this vision for Israel or whether he too will need to make concessions based on the perceived political realities of the time.                 

## 47 The sounding of the Trump(ets) at the cusp of a new generational dawn

The Lord spoke further to Moses, saying “Make yourself two trumpets of silver, of hammered work you shall make them; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for having the camps set out." Numbers 10:1-2

Trumpets were used in the First and Second Temple periods to usher in a new day and on the opening of the Temple gates. They are among the musical instruments on display at the Temple Institute in Jerusalem. Priests from the Mikdash Youth practise with Temple era trumpets as part of their training for the Tamid sacrificial offering and candle lighting in a future Third Temple. The golden Menorah standing today opposite the site of the Holy Temple was installed to the sound of silver trumpets just as Moses was instructed to make silver trumpets in biblical times. As I write this (November 2024) Donald Trump has fought back against widespread online censorship, lawfare conducted by his political opponents and assassination attempts to regain the US Presidency winning the popular vote for the Republicans for the first time in two decades. The inbox he faces as he prepares to be sworn in as the 47th President in January 2025 is the most daunting and lengthy of any new President since the Great Depression and World War 2. Whether it is domestically or internationally where a new global order seems to be on the horizon Trump's next term has the potential to be a critical turning point in world history. Four years is not a long time in the grand scheme of things and in the absence of a Franklin D Roosevelt style third term you'd expect Trump would settle for a domestic focused legacy potentially taking his place on Mount Rushmore next to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. With regards to Israel Trump already has a legacy from his first term of moving the American embassy to Jerusalem recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital, of recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and normalizing Israeli relations with surrounding Arab states in the Abraham Accords. There is a new settlement, Trump Heights, named after him in the Golan Heights. What more could Trump do, and indeed should Trump do with an Israel seeking less reliance on the United States, in his second term? The glaring issue which you suspect Israel would be unable to deal with on its own, and the issue which overlaps with Netanyahu's own legacy, is the nuclear threat from Iran. An Iran armed with a nuclear bomb would be unacceptable to both Israel and a Trump led United States and hence is expected to be the top priority of any second term Israel policy. There could very well be additional lands recognized by the United States as Israeli territory in Gaza, Judea and Samaria. A dark horse addition to the Trump legacy before he ends his second term, especially if he has his eye on etching his name on history measured in the millennia rather than the merely the centuries, would be to signal his support for the rebuilding of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. There is a path, though challenging and fraught with some risk, for a newly elected President Trump to sound the trumpet on the biggest real estate development of all time.

"In a Torah sense we have to leave the behavior pattern of Jacob, which is more a kind of tricky, clever, knowing how to balance things, knowing how to say the right things at the right moment; with Israel, which is straight, clear policy.... That makes for good deals, that makes for good policy." Yishai Fleisher

Certain instances in history present a generational opportunity for a step change and a turning point to pivot towards the optimal path. After 12 years out of the last 16 years battling an Obama directed foreign policy that was mistrustful of Israel, seeking to constrain it and where possible sideline it in the Middle East you would forgive a 75 year old Netanyahu for struggling to complete the near instant 180 degree turn that the moment requires. A transactional, deal oriented President Trump nearly four decades on from writing "The Art of the Deal" who clearly from his first term envisages a brighter future for Israel than his predecessors at the start of what is expected to be his last term presents that opportunity for a generational turning point if such a moment ever exists.

## 48 One Jewish state: The final solution

"And if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those that you let remain of them shall be thorns in your eyes and thistles in your sides and shall torment you in the land wherein you dwell." Numbers 33:55

The sticking point today and in Kahane's time complicating the exertion of full Israeli sovereignty over Gaza, Judea and Samaria is and has been the presence of millions of Arab, Muslim inhabitants, many of which do not want to live in the world's only Jewish state to the extent that they support terrorism and the indiscriminate killing of Jewish Israelis in an attempt to destroy the Jewish state from within. It is blatantly obvious that these inhabitants should not be residing in the Jewish state and allowing them to remain is an act of seemingly intentional self harm. Empathy is a noble trait but it has its limits before it starts to become suicidal. You may invite a downtrodden individual into your home as an act of goodwill but if you allow them to remain in your home after they attempt to kill your wife and rape your daughter then the responsibility for what happens next is entirely yours. Where should they go? There are a minimum of 19 nation states with Arab majorities who if they had a modicum of affinity and compassion for their fellow Arab would offer citizenship to those who wanted to live in a majority Arab and/or majority Muslim country. The fact that they haven't thus far offered this option is a reflection of these countries using Arab populations residing in Israel as a stategic weapon to undermine the Jewish state and/or a reflection of the Arab citizens within Israel being perceived as troublesome no matter what country they reside in. In the absence of any of these Arab majority nation states offering citizenship pathways to their fellow Arab like Israel offers citizenship pathways to fellow Jews they will need to be deported to a country that Israel enters a deal with just as the UK partnered with Rwanda for the UK-Rwanda Migration and Economic Development Partnership (2022).

A common criticism of this security first approach that takes protecting Israel's Jewish citizens from Arab terrorists seriously is that it resembles Hitler's treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. After suffering from Nazi persecution and ultimately the Holocaust are the Jews carrying out their own Holocaust on the Arab population within Israel? To risk sounding trite has the hunted become the hunter? I think it is a valuable question to keep in mind as Israel guards the ethics on which it judges itself but the comparison breaks down under even the slightest pressure. Hitler was seeking a genetic and ideological purity that had no place for a single Jew of any religious or political persuasion either within Nazi Germany or his designs for the European continent. This was driven by a visceral hatred of Jews and a belief that though small in number they were succeeding in bringing about the destruction of his country through non-violent means. Kahane and his ideological progeny today do not hate Arabs, nor are they seeking to "purify" Israel of Arabs let alone the entire Middle East. There are Israeli Arabs serving today in the Israel Defense Forces, Israeli Arab parliamentary members of the Knesset and Israeli Arabs representing the national football team. There has been and will be no Israeli parallel of Hitler looking down disdainfully at Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Olympics for bringing Aryan supremacy into disrepute. There is a place in Israeli society for a peaceful Arab minority who will pledge allegiance to a Jewish state and serve the best interests of that Jewish state. However, there is no place in the Jewish state for any Arab who seeks to undermine, breakup or ultimately destroy the Jewish state in which they reside. That approach historically aligns with every other nascent Western nation state. A security first approach rather than a suicidal empathy approach means prioritizing the safety of Jewish citizens when unsure of the threat posed by an Arab resident.

Once the security considerations had been taken care of and you were able to identify a subset of the Arab populations in Gaza, Judea, Samaria that posed no security threat, were willing to pledge allegiance to a Jewish state and would prefer to remain in Israel as a peaceful Arab minority than leave for a Arab majority nation state the next consideration becomes long term Israeli population demographics. As David Friedman, President Trump's Ambassador to Israel in his first term, discusses in his book "One Jewish State" (2024) a Jewish state is only viable in the long term if it has a Jewish majority and one suspects a significant Jewish majority to enshrine Jewish rights within a democracy permanently. He outlines the precedent of Puerto Rico where the United States maintains full sovereignty over the territory and its residents have US citizenship but without the right to vote in US national elections. There is a similar dynamic with some business corporations that have two classes of voting stock: Class A that have voting control of the company and Class B that does not. In the case that a subset of the Arab populations meeting robust criteria for Israeli citizenship was starting to cause Jewish majority concerns Israel could implement something similar for that subset. But the biblical passage from Numbers 33:55 serves as a warning to remain vigilant, not slip into suicidal empathy and not complacently collect pockets of thorns and thistles that will only serve to engender future intifadas and yet more unnecessary Jewish bloodshed.

## 49 A defense of Judeo-Christian values: A marriage of old and new

The intersection or barrier between Judaism and Christianity presents an opportunity for those who seek to disrupt or overturn the Western global order. Convince Jews to be disdainful of the idol worshipping Christians and convince Christians to despise the Jews for killing a fellow Jew (Jesus) or having a superiority complex, turn the old against the new and feast on the chaos as the Western global order crumbles. In reality there is no reason why Judaism and Christianity can't be complements. Judaism doesn't scale to billions of people whilst Christianity does. Judaism doesn't proselytize whilst Christianity does. Judaism as a generalization perceives itself as an ethnicity, as a people with a deep connection to the Holy Land in addition to an effective religion whilst Christianity perceives itself as exclusively a religion for any people in any land. Jews had a relationship with G\*d prior to Jesus and hence don't believe that "No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6) but Christians didn't and hence do. Jews lived their lives according to the commandments of the Torah (Old Testament) prior to Jesus and didn't see the need to start afresh on the emergence of Jesus. Today when Jews and Christians work together the old Holy Land is secured from internal and external threats and new technologies connect the world and help humanity explore the stars. The question of whether the barrier between Judaism and Christianity is an absorbing one (blocking movement) or a permeable one (allows some diffusion) is a challenging one. Judaism has an insecurity over numbers which Christianity doesn't have and seeks to not lose Jews to assimilation or intermarriage. It is possible for a non-Jew to convert to Judaism but it is deliberately made arduous to ensure they are converting for the right reasons and won't later revert back to their prior lifestyle and belief system. In comparison Christianity is relatively easy to convert to. Without Judaism there would have been no Jesus and without Christianity there would be little of the Western civilization and order that Israel was reborn into in the 20th century.

Disdain or antipathy towards Judaism from the perspective of Christianity makes very little sense. Judaism not proselytizing and not attempting to introduce a new prophet to reduce the centrality of Jesus ensures it isn't a threat. Without an ethnic motivation or some other force for deeper curiosity Judaism's 613 commandments seem overbearing and unnecessary. Once you have a human representation of G\*d on earth (Jesus) with a face, a voice and a life story it is difficult to go back to attempting a connection with an infinite being without a face, voice or life story from the confines of the relatively tiny and limited human mind. However, that is what Judaism attempts. No matter how supposedly mundane the human action is; whether it be entering a room through a door, going to the toilet or waking from sleep, Judaism attempts through touching a Torah parchment (mezuzah), reciting a blessing or putting on a headcovering (kippah) to elevate that action to something approaching holiness, recognizing the hand of G\*d in everything we take for granted. It is difficult for a Christian worshipping the same G\*d to sneer at these traditions that were designed as a regular reminder of G\*d's presence, were most likely completed by Jesus during his lifetime and that instill gratitude for even the most basic of needs being met. Even if that Christian doesn't feel obligated to follow those traditions themselves after the instruction of Jesus and his disciples.

"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of G\*d" Mark 10:25

However, what is colloquially known as the West and the Christian world has not been in worse shape since the Great Depression and World War 2. A perfect storm of quantitative easing (money printing), winner take all dynamics with internet companies, a rootless global billionaire class who have extricated themselves from  nationalities and nation states and perhaps most importantly religion and G\*d in addition to the cover ups of child sexual exploitation from Jeffrey Epstein to the Muslim grooming gangs in the UK have left the West financially and morally bankrupt. The internet that initially started as a new world of opportunity for hackers and hobbyists and generated unimaginable riches for billionaires like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Andreessen is now wielded by those same individuals to control public opinion, censor discussion, push cryptocurrency scams and misdirect the potential next generation of hackers and hobbyists into thinking their skills are no longer useful. The tendency to idol worship which Jews have always been suspicious of now has everyone from senior politicians to teenagers desperate for a like or retweet from Elon Musk like beggars scrabbling for coins thrown in their direction. As their wealth and power spirals they become more and more disconnected from the person they were when they were working day and night to build their companies and pull the ladders up so their younger equivalents can't embark on a similar path. The masses are increasingly impoverished, desperate and manipulated by their base desires with no avenues to materially change anything about their societies that seem to sinking inexorably into the morass. Israel was reborn into Western civilization but there is increasingly less and less that Western civilization has to offer it other than a cautionary tale on what not to do. Although one hopes the reelection of President Trump will present a turning point it is also dangerous to pin your entire hopes on one flawed if potentially transformative 78 year old man and fall into the same idol worship trap as the attention beggars on Twitter with Musk.

## 50 Does the Jewish state believe in Judaism?

"Belief is a gritty, potent, primordial force. In the 1950s a scientist named Dr. Curt Richter proved this when he gathered dozens of rats and dropped them into thirty inch deep glass cylinders filled with water. The first rat paddled on the surface for a short time, then swam to the bottom where it looked for an escape hatch. It died within two minutes. Several others followed that same pattern. Some lasted as long as 15 minutes but they all gave up. Richter was surprised because rats are damn good swimmers yet in his lab they drowned without much of a fight. So he tweaked the test. After he placed the next batch in their jars Richter watched them and right before it looked like they were about to give up he and his techs scooped up the rats, toweled them off and held them long enough for their heart and respiratory rates to normalize. Long enough for them to register on a physiological scale that they had been saved. They did this a few times before Richter placed a group of them back into those evil cylinders again to see how long they would last on their own. This time the rats didn't give up. They swam their natural asses off for an average of 60 hours without any food or rest. One swam for 81 hours." David Goggins (Never Finished)

When flailing in metaphorical waters it is inevitable that a human starts to ask themselves existential questions like why am I suffering, what is the point (if any) to my suffering and for how long am I willing to continue suffering for. Viktor Frankl describes in Man's Search For Meaning how the "wire", an electrically charged barbed wire fence presented a daily opportunity to end the suffering in the concentration camp of Auschwitz. Through this rather bleak experiment (Richter was effectively playing the role of G\*d and was more than willing to let the rats be fooled by false hope and ultimately perish) Richter demonstrated that what ultimately mattered to the rats and was the difference between giving up within 15 minutes or persisting for up to 81 hours was their belief that their suffering was not only being observed by a higher power but could be assuaged by a higher power. The biggest question humans are ultimately faced with is does such a higher power exist? If it doesn't and one is certain of it there is very little reason to prolong the suffering beyond the metaphorical 15 minutes. Ultimately the suffering is meaningless. Perhaps the suffering diminishes over time but if it doesn't and you can't see a route out of that suffering the checking out after 15 minutes might seem preferable to eventually checking out after 81 hours. Alternatively if one suspects there is a higher power but has no idea what form this higher power takes the natural follow up question is is this higher power benevolent and does it care about me, is it indifferent to my plight like Richter with his rats or worse is it downright malevolent and seeks to maximize my suffering? You are now in the terrain of religion and seeking to understand as best you can with your limited human brain the higher power, what in Judaism or Christianity would call G\*d.

Once you move up the levels of abstraction from the individual to the level of the nation state you could ask a similar question. What for example does Israel believe? Does it believe that it is just one of many nation states littered around the world that aspires to offer a Western level of modernity and security to its citizens? Or does it have a higher purpose? What should the priority be? Progress towards the rebuilding of a Third Temple to worship G\*d and orientate the religious community around or improved economic arrangements with its Arab neighbors? Does it model itself on an American state and effectively be "another star in the American flag" which Ben-Gvir insisted it was not? Or is it a Jewish state with biblically ordained borders oriented around Judaism and prioritizes its objectives based on that belief system even if it diverges from American objectives and quasi Christian morals? Ultimately does it believe in G\*d and that G\*d wants Israel, no matter what the human opposition is, to build an authentically Jewish state with G\*d and the Torah at its center and to fulfill being that "light unto the nations" (Isaiah 42:6)? Because if G\*d doesn't exist, the biblical stories are mere fiction and the Third Temple is a pipedream for the crazy religious fundamentalists that the Americans and the Arabs will never allow what sustains the modern reincarnation of Israel past its initial 15 minutes of flailing around in the violent and dangerous waters of the Middle East?

Without the belief in a higher power something has to inevitably fill the void. You cannot decide on what should be prioritized consciously or subconsciously without being led by some kind of lodestar. There has to be a reason why you get out the bed in the morning or why you complete activities that don't bring instant pleasure and/or joy. Some lodestars are healthier and more honorable than others. Providing for children and a family is a healthier lodestar than say maximizing personal pleasure ignoring the consequences on others. Caring about your personal legacy and wanting to remain relevant after you've died is a healthier lodestar than mindlessly maximizing your personal financial wealth by harming others and impoverishing your fellow citizens. However, even these examples of relatively healthier lodestars are still substituting personal ego into the void of where belief in a higher power would otherwise be. A higher power like Richter with his rats would be able to observe the entire system and see where ensuring your lazy, entitled children are billionaires is not necessarily a net good for the rest of society. A higher power would be able to see where a political leader was prioritizing his political survival or personal legacy over what was best for his country in the long term. The most significant question is whether there is a higher power or not because everything flows from it. If you believe in one you obviously don't throw out your responsibilities to your children or stop caring about what your personal legacy is going to be. But that is not the ultimate lodestar. The ultimate lodestar is what that higher power expects from you and why that higher power put you on this planet in the first place. The Torah lays out what a higher power wants and expects from Israel. Ignoring that and filling the void with other motivational factors may be better than some of the alternatives but it is not optimal. Again what remains of Israel if you throw out G\*d, the Torah and Judaism? What was the point of surviving and persisting through two millennia of exile and suffering? What was the point of the century of bloodshed and toil to reestablish the nation state of Israel? The ultimate lodestar has always been the higher power.

"When you get to heaven, let's say that's true, let's say G\*d does know all, and when you get there G\*d has a chart and the chart has your name on it. That chart tells you what you should have been and you missed the mark by a lot. When you get to heaven are you really in heaven or are you in hell? So my mindset now, with all that being said is, I do believe that G\*d has a chart up there and I know that G\*d knows all and that puts the fear of G\*d in me.... I want to exceed even G\*d's expectations of what he thought I was capable of. I want G\*d to be up there saying "I don't believe it. Not even I saw what David Goggins was capable of." That's the mindset that we all need to have for the rest of our lives. We need to shoot for more than what we even thought was possible." David Goggins (Can't Hurt Me)

Most of the problems afflicting Israel today are not rocket science. Humanity knows how to build prisons and knows how to deport individuals that pose a threat to the security of the nation state and the safety of its citizens. It knows how to build constructions like the Third Temple and indeed has known for many centuries. If 50 years from now Israel is still fighting waves of terrorism from within and is still offering to trade away its lands to appease the terrorists it will be because its leaders prioritized their self interest, financial gain and allegiances to other nation states over G\*d, the Jewish state and Judaism. G\*d's chart will show the Jewish people missed the mark by a lot let alone shooting for more than what was thought possible. As with the Holocaust, the terrorist attacks of October 7th present an opportunity for a new beginning and finally pursuing the correct path that Kahane laid out nearly 50 years ago. If it continues to trade away G\*d's inheritance and aspirations for the Jewish state there will be more Holocausts and there will be more October 7ths. And Israel's leaders will have no one to blame but themselves.

## 51 Via Negativa

In Nassim Taleb's Antifragile he discusses the concept of "via negativa" where the solution to overcoming entrenched challenges is commonly to strip away everything and everyone that don't align with the ultimate goal so that time and effort isn't wasted on the roadblocks and those who are indifferent or adversarial to that ultimate goal. He describes the process of Michelangelo carving the statue of David using the simple maxim "I just remove everything that is not David". Similarly in political systems failing to remove the bad guy can cause more harm than the progress made by the collective actions of the good guys. The Holy Temple in Jerusalem contained a Holy of Holies, the innermost part and G\*d's dwelling place, which only the High Priest was allowed access to and only at specific times. You wouldn't allow the sinful or enemies of the Jewish state into the Holy of Holies and yet other institutions that are supposedly working on behalf of the Jewish state such as Israel's Parliament, the Knesset, contain representatives that want to give away Israel's land bequeathed by G\*d, foster fledgling terrorist states on its borders and are indifferent to directly or indirectly facilitating large scale terrorist attacks happening within Israel over and over again, year on year, decade on decade. The Knesset will never be a Holy Temple let alone a Holy of Holies but whilst it bans truth tellers like Kahane, defers to unelected bureaucrats rather than elected representatives and accepts breaking up the state to form adversarial new ones as a valid topic of discussion it will never make progress towards its ultimate goals. It will forever be a place that rubberstamps generation after generation being subject to terrorism and progress towards a Third Temple being stunted by those who don't have the interests of the Jewish state at heart in the first place.

One of the most insidious roadblocks that subtly strengthens over time and saps the strength of those seeking to overcome entrenched challenges is third party dependencies. Dependencies are insidious because at first their introduction seem to instantly solve a problem and allow you to move on without addressing why you weren't able to resolve the problem yourself. What initially plugged a hole to your great relief over time ends up constraining and paralyzing you. At the very least you are surrendering control to a third party and if in addition it is a black box (closed source) you are also accepting that your understanding of the problem space and solution space will only weaken over time to the benefit of the third party. The trade-off is most obviously seen in software development as building a minimum viable product (MVP) in the shortest possible time collects an ever expanding mountain of dependencies to such an extent that it is often ditched entirely to start afresh once product-market fit is found. Statecraft encounters a very similar dynamic especially for small and/or nascent nation states economically, technologically and militarily. For the UK what started as outsourcing the experimentation and building of innovative new online platforms to Silicon Valley ended up in huge swathes of its economy being controlled from there. Revenues, profits and taxes which previously would circulate around the UK economy are increasingly travelling across the ocean instead. What started as something resembling an equal partners relationship between the UK and US with some even describing it as the "special relationship" ended up with the UK emerging as an obvious vassal state. Again in software development there is the concept of a "thin client" or worse a "dumb client" where all the logic and computation is carried out on an external server but you present a thin interface layer to the user. In this analogy the UK economy ended up being merely a "dumb client" to its citizens. A country for immigrant Deliveroo drivers managed from Silicon Valley dressed up as a globally competitive economy.

Nascent nation (and city) states generally can't avoid significant dependency trade-offs regardless of how competent its early leaders. In the aftermath of declaring independence in 1965 Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was desperate for the British not to leave and lobbied British politicians to that effect. Singapore's primary role to that point had been the administrative, commercial and military hub of the British Empire in Southeast Asia. Approximately 20 percent of Singapore's GDP was made up of British military spending (From Third World To First, Lee Kuan Yew). Lee Kuan Yew feared that a speedy British withdrawal would leave Singapore defenseless, with a collapsing economy and lacking international credibility without sufficient time to address these challenges. He understood that permanent dependence on the British wasn't an option but that winding down that dependence and emerging as a viable independent state would take time. Singapore experienced similar challenges to Israel that had declared independence a couple of decades earlier (1948). Indeed in those early years there was considerable collaboration between the two with Israel selling refurbished tanks and armored vehicles to Singapore in addition to providing military training. Whether it was conscious of the military threats back home or merely avoiding the introduction of a new dependence the Israelis "insisted from the very start that our officers learn from them and take over as instructors as soon as possible". The plans for mobilizing an army and introducing national service were also heavily influenced by the Israeli operation years earlier. As the United States emerges from an apparent nadir under President Trump's new and revitalized administration and it starts to flex its muscles on the world stage again dependence on the Americans is going to be a critical issue for a number of small(er) nation states. For some they will take the role of a young Lee Kuan Yew pleading with the greater power not to desert them. For others they may see returning American strength as the answer to a problem they haven't been to solve themselves with their own military, diplomacy and dysfunctional branches of government. The early signs as I write this in February 2025 is that Netanyahu has assessed that not only can Israel not deal with the Iranian nuclear threat without the Americans, it can't even execute long term solutions for Gaza, Judea and Samaria without the Americans.

To what extent this assessment is correct is unclear. From an outsider looking in Netanyahu's current coalition has attempted (and thus far failed to pass) judicial reform loosening the straitjacket that Israel's immensely powerful Supreme Court has on Israel's democratically elected Knesset. Netanyahu has gone into coalition with Ben-Gvir's Otzma Yehudit and Smotrich's Religious Zionist parties who would instantly sign up to a future that doesn't include neverending rocket attacks and waves of terrorism from aspiring terror states formed on Israel's land. It may very well be that Netanyahu is correct that he can't do anymore other than bypassing Israel's branches of government and instead leaning on the higher power of the Americans offering them land in return. As with all third party dependencies though the initial relief or euphoria of bypassing the dead ends of an internal maze over time will inevitably turn to concern over trade-offs between Israeli and American interests and increasing overreliance on the Americans. By then it won't be Netanyahu's problem and he may very well think he has done the right thing for Israel. Time will tell. 

## 52 The network(ed) state

The superior strategy for small and/or nascent nation states is to focus on networks. Rather than exclusively clinging to a superpower protectorate you identify other small nation (and city) states that are aspiring for overperformance from the mean, perhaps driven too by a sense of paranoia that without overperformance, differentiation and an element of self sufficiency there is no reason for such a nation state to exist in the long term. It is just a question of which empire you are consumed by and which superpower you are a satellite or a vassal state of. That is not to say that a dependence on a superpower can be reduced to zero but it can be minimized. There will inevitably be global issues such as management of nuclear weapons that can only ultimately be underwritten at the superpower level. But the vast majority of a nation state's economy, technology and military does not need to be exclusively dependent on a superpower. Unlike the world of atoms which naturally forms and reorganizes around growing and shrinking empires, the world of bits' natural state is to be structured via networks. The infrastructure of even large technology behemoths like Google and Facebook will be structured as a network with redundant servers and geographically positioned servers to ensure their sites are responsive to their users and they don't need to constantly query a server halfway across the world. Indeed the internet and Bitcoin are themselves networks of servers. What libertarian, futurist books like The Sovereign Individual (Davidson, Rees-Mogg) and The Network State (Srinivasan) downplay and in my opinion get wrong is the difficulty of establishing land, borders, a military defending those borders and an enforceable immigration strategy in the world of atoms and the decades (if not centuries) it takes to embed them. In the world of bits a server can be spun up and spun down in seconds. Bitcoin can be moved, hacked and stolen in seconds. But building a credible, viable nation (or city) state takes decades at a minimum and going world of bits first hoping you can do the world of atoms part later is laughably naive. As a strategy for already existing small nation states managing their dependencies thinking in terms of networks makes a lot of sense. Unlike helplessly rising and falling with your superpower protectorate between Trump style peaks and Biden style troughs you can grow and strengthen regardless of who is in charge and what is happening with your superpower. You can credibly be treated as a valuable if not entirely equal partner in your future dealings with them and negotiate better economic and defense sharing terms from a position of strength. Ideally your dependence on them would be minimized to the global nuclear weapons style risks no small nation state can manage on their own. Networks are flexible and versatile. Nodes on the network can join and leave without taking you or the entire network down with them. A rising nation state could join and a failing nation state could leave ensuring dependencies are temporary rather than permanent and could be swapped out. The problems a small nation state encounters such as a small internal market for their products and services and expertise limited to particular niches can be solved without clinging to a superpower protectorate.

Since experiencing hyperinflation in the 1980s and under the leadership of Shimon Peres and Benjamin Netanyahu Israel has emerged as a potential node on such a global network of overperforming small nation states. However, it is in a region (the Middle East) where although money and oil are plentiful there aren't obvious candidates for other nodes on such a network. In addition, the region contains other nation states that are dependent on US aid (e.g. Egypt, Jordan) and/or others that are so fragile and volatile that they may not exist in such a form in a decade or two. It is one of many reasons why in recent years the US has been attempting a pivot towards Asia where there are obvious candidates (e.g. Singapore, Taiwan) for such a network in addition to less Islamist terrorists seeking to cause death and destruction. As with other small nation states the defense challenges are obviously still present though they vary hugely from case to case. What doesn't vary though is the critical strategic importance to those nation (and city) states of continuing overperformance. If Taiwan's economy represented Crimea's economy for example you would expect it to have already suffered a similar fate, being annexed by its nearby superpower with little opposition from other superpowers. The primary reason there has been a stand off between China and US over the fate of this island is its critical importance in the global economy to the production of semiconductors and its chip fabrication plants. With the world of bits continuing to rise in importance relative to the world of atoms Taiwan produces approximately 90 percent of the world's most advanced semiconductors primarily through TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) (The Economist, June 2024). Taiwan doesn't bet all its defense chips (no pun intended) on maintaining its strategic importance to the US and pursues independent porcupine-like military strategies to increase the difficulty and costs of a potential attempted Chinese annexation. But it is effectively overperformance or bust in the long term if it wants to be a viable independent nation state. The risk for Israel if it continues to drag its feet resolving once and for all the carnage emanating from Gaza, Judea and Samaria during this Trump induced window of opportunity is not only does it start to surrender the economic and technological gains of recent decades and atrophy, it also starts to resemble a neverending headache in a region that offers an abundance of neverending headaches and aid dependence. By contrast some of Asia's headaches are accompanied with vast economic and technological upside. Everything is pointing towards decisiveness, clear objectives and lasting solutions regardless of whether Israel wants to be an American satellite or a viable independent nation state. The concern is whether Netanyahu is capable and/or willing to execute on that before he starts to test Trump's and the Americans' patience or worse the Trump induced window expires. Other small nation states remain focused on economic and technological overperformance. Israel can't afford to give up on that. 

"A tree has many branches, and these look like small trees; further, these large branches have many more smaller branches that sort of look like even smaller trees. This is a manifestation of what is called fractal self-similarity, a vision by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. There is a similar hierarchy in things and we just see the top layer from the outside. The cell has a population of intercellular molecules; in turn the organism has a population of cells, and the species has a population of organisms." Nassim Taleb

Like the tree structure with each branch looking like a small tree, the network structure contains nodes that under a magnifying glass are themselves networks. Israel could be perceived as a single node on a global network of nation states or a network of Israeli individuals with each individual representing a node on such a network. Without building and leveraging a network Theodor Herzl would have been unable to bring about the modern reincarnation of the nation state of Israel and without building and leveraging a network Ze'ev Jabotinsky would have been unable to defend it. Rabbi Meir Kahane's network growth was stunted first by his Knesset ban and ultimately by the hands of a Islamic terrorist. But his dream of the ultimate fulfillment of religious Zionism didn't die with him. Infusing the Knesset's menorah shaped seating with G\*d and Judaism, securing the borders and refusing to trade the future deaths of Israelis for short term popularity are just as urgent today as they were in Kahane's time. Each generation that fails to rebuild the Temple it is as if that generation destroyed it. The network that believes in this needs to continue to grow and strengthen to make it an inevitability and bypass the individuals who despite appearances prioritize their own political survival and self interest over G\*d's. The Illuminati was formed in Germany nearly two and a half centuries ago as a secret network that tried to change the world (The Square and the Tower, Niall Ferguson). Israel needs a public network that isn't willing to be part of yet another generation that effectively destroys the Temple.

## 53 Hidden things

"For this reason, G\*d called sins _alumim_, hidden things... The sins we try to hide remain in plain sight of G\*d. Nothing escapes his glance... G\*d therefore called the evildoer who tries to hide from duty a _na'alam_, one hidden away." Rabbi Meir Kahane

The Hebrew root alam (עלם) means to conceal or to hide. It appears in various places in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and the Old Testament such as Psalms 90:8. The Hebrew for youth or youthfulness (alumim, עלומים) is also rooted in the word alam (עלם). It is as if the ultimate capabilities of the youth is hidden as is the capacity to sin without being able to fully comprehend the consequences. Over time via trial and error, learning about the complex system(s) in which they operate and with the help of religious texts such as the Torah the youth can mature and not hide from duty though some do the opposite and permanently hide to such an extent that they are considered "dead in their lifetime". Over sufficient time the hidden can bubble up to the surface even to the human eye. Steve Jobs obsessively cared about the aesthetics of his Apple computers right down to the internal circuit boards that would never be visible to the end user stating "A great carpenter isn't going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet even though nobody's going to see it." (Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson). Jobs justified the extra cost and time spent on internal design by positing he wouldn't be able to sleep at night if the quality wasn't carried all the way through. Whoever it was, whether it be a hobbyist disassembling an Apple computer at home or a future Apple engineer iterating on past designs, Jobs couldn't bear the thought of leaving a bad taste in their mouths when they stumbled upon corners being cut and the aesthetics of the internals disappointing when compared to the aesthetics of the externals. Though he didn't state it he seemed to understand intuitively that if Apple was going to survive and thrive in the long term it couldn't afford to let mediocrity and complacency seep into any part of its designs however hidden away and low level they were. As Nassim Taleb quoted a sixth century poet (Simonides of Ceos) in Antifragile "Time has sharp teeth that destroy everything". Choosing to disappoint or worse repulse an initially tiny stream of hobbyists and Apple engineers could seed the premature discardment of Jobs' designs if not the discardment of Apple products entirely.

Individual humans, created and designed by G\*d via the invisible hand of Mother Nature, cannot redesign or restructure their hidden internals. The makeup of their DNA and their more complex organs such as the brain are largely inherited. They are handed a body that evolves over time and a specified time interval to use that body towards whichever goals and objectives they choose. Again the most significant overriding question when considering life goals is whether such a higher power exists because ultimately what your ego or your bestial urges want pale into insignificance when compared to what a higher power might want. The drowning rat might want dominion over the other drowning rats or to fornicate with the other drowning rats but ultimately what the drowning rat wants is an irrelevance when compared to what Richter as the higher power wanted from them. There was a life outside of the water filled jars that none of the drowning rats and only Richter could grant access to. To go through a human lifetime without attempting to understand or connect with that higher power and being ruled by one's own selfish urges from birth to death is hiding away from the (infinitely) bigger picture and hiding the (infinite) downsides of doing so within oneself. An Apple computer will be sitting in a rubbish skip somewhere long after today's human bodies have all decomposed. 

In 1770 Wolfgang von Kempelen unveiled a machine called the Mechanical Turk that was capable of playing chess against humans. During 84 years of demonstrations it reportedly defeated amongst others Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin (Wikipedia). It was only later that it was revealed to the public that the machine had been hiding a human chessmaster within it all this time and could not operate without one. Today, over two centuries later, we have machines in our pockets that actually are capable of this without the hidden human. Humans have designed and built these machines, they've programmed the software and trained the software on vast datasets but when you play chess against the computer you can now be confident there isn't a human hidden within the machine determining each move. The modern day Wolfgang von Kempelens, the Sam Altmans and the Elon Musks when he isn't building cars and rockets that do actually work, are claiming humanity is on the cusp of artificial general intelligence (AGI) which could be substituted for a human in any scientific or technical field or for G\*d himself. As with von Kempelen it is difficult to assess what is driving and motivating their misdirection. They are exceptionally wealthy, valued in the billions of dollars, and Musk especially is associated with legitimate companies and products that don't require fanciful claims. It is stupidity or greed and one would assume it is more likely to be the latter. Even if you ignored the humans who built the machines, programmed the software and provided the datasets in the chess example, going from a two dimensional chessboard with 64 squares and chess pieces that have restrictive rules on which squares they can move into to the equivalent of an infinite dimensional chessboard with infinite squares, an infinite number of chess pieces that can change and evolve in an infinite number of ways and next to zero rules on which squares they can move into is falling into the trap of what Taleb describes as the "ludic fallacy". The ludic which is "set up like a game, with its rules supplied in advance in an explicit way" and the ecological where "we don't know the rules and cannot isolate variables". One could argue von Kempelen did no harm other than fool a few gullible celebrities. Today's von Kempelens are misdirecting capital to enrich themselves yet further and worse misdirecting young humans away from learning the skills to contribute to scientific or technical fields for fear of being replaced by a fraudulent Mechanical Turk. It is one of the uglier sins to pull the ladder up after you that made you a billionaire just so you can make yet more billions.

Consider the thought experiment where AGI actually was possible and you could replace the world's best doctors, engineers, lawyers, farmers, builders, manufacturers and Silicon Valley billionaires spouting drivel with machines. The cost of accessing these services would reduce down to the cost of electricity to keep these machines up and running assuming the Silicon Valley billionaires didn't impose license fees. Whatever need you might have whether it be medical, technical, legal, sustenance, shelter, products or a need to lose brain cells by listening to the Silicon Valley billionaires could be met at the cost of electricity. Need the best medical advice? Ping the server. Need a website built for you? Ping the server. Need food? Ping the server. Need a new house on land you own? Ping the server. And that's just replacing the most qualified humans. Want to replace G\*d? Want to turn Mars into the Garden of Eden? Ping the server. America has produced some pretty exceptional fraudsters in recent years from Bernie Madoff to Elizabeth Holmes to Jeffrey Skilling but what the Sam Altmans and Elon Musks are attempting to convince you of beats them all. The reality is the road for these Silicon Valley billionaires to milk their effective monopolies is running out and to continue milking them they need to prevent new generations from learning the skills they learned, build protective moats around their decaying infrastructures and user experiences and ensure the "dumb clients" become as dumb and helpless as the UK has become. The "bicycle of the mind" Steve Jobs wanted to build to augment and extend human capabilities has turned into a dystopia where the masses are helpless herds of cows being led by their base, bestial desires by utterly shameless von Kempelen figures.

Technology is and always has been a force multiplier both on the upside and on the downside. The invention of the knife allowed humans to cut food more cleanly and effectively than the human tooth. Yet it also made it easier to kill another human compared to using bare hands. The invention of the car allowed humans to travel distances much more quickly than via horse or bicycle. Yet it also facilitated car crashes and terrorist attacks mowing down innocent pedestrians. The computer, smartphone and the internet are no different. They allow you to communicate with a person halfway around the world instantly versus waiting for a pigeon or a postal letter to physically travel there. They allow you to watch a presentation or lecture from the world's most renowned expert in that field in real time without being in the room. The upsides are truly vast. But in the absence of open source transparency those upsides can easily be strangled by unethical, powerful and incredibly wealthy individuals with their hands on the controls and the downsides accentuated. A knife manufacturer could never get away with blunting the knife to make it unusable for cutting food whilst simultaneously encouraging its customers to use it to kill other people. A car manufacturer could never get away with selling a car that was no quicker than a horse whilst simultaneously introducing a button to lurch onto the pavement and kill pedestrians. And yet the equivalent of that is happening online.

## 54 The Third Temple generation

The building of the Third Temple can by definition only happen once. It is the ultimate zero to one moment to again paraphrase Peter Thiel. Hence it requires a generation that not only thinks it is viable and realistic in their lifetimes but that it is their generation that deserves to see its rebuilding when countless generations before them did not. In reality you could argue that necessary prerequisites were a reformation of the nation state and a recapturing of the Temple Mount which occurred in 1948 and 1967 respectively. But why did the generation post 1967 not see the commencement of building? Perhaps there were defense and economic challenges that needed to be resolved before it did. It is difficult to divert resources and collective mindshare to the potential pinnacle of your civilization when war and hyperinflation are raging. There may be a window of opportunity for today's generation that didn't present itself to the post Holocaust generation or the post Temple Mount recapturing generation. Just like the reformation of the nation state emerged post Holocaust it is possible the rebuilding of the Third Temple emerges post October 7th terrorist attacks and post the multitude of military endeavors in its immediate aftermath. The stepping stone today's generation is on is high profile politicians like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Moshe Feiglin praying on the Temple Mount and not treating Israeli sovereignty over it as an afterthought. An upcoming stepping stone may be an elected leader of Israel formally ditching the post 1967 status quo agreement that treats Judaism's holiest site in the center of Israel's capital as foreign territory. A future stepping stone may be the announcement of plans to remove physical obstacles to the rebuilding of the Third Temple such as the Dome of the Rock and transfer them to an alternative location for historical safekeeping and maintenance. For the commencement of building to happen for today's generation it does need new stepping stones and plans to be generated to follow Ben-Gvir's and Feiglin's admirable efforts to bring the center of Judaism back to the center of the Jewish people's collective psyche.

"Beginnings are special. They are qualitatively different from all that comes afterward. This was true 13.8 billion years ago, at the founding of our cosmos: in the earliest microseconds of its existence, the universe expanded by a factor of 10^30 - a million trillion trillion. As cosmogonic epochs came and went in those first few moments, the very laws of physics were different from those we know today." Peter Thiel

Beginnings are certainly special but to the human mind they are also mysterious and enigmatic. From G\*d creating the heaven and the earth with a Big Bang to the spark of light from a fertilized human egg to the genesis Bitcoin block setting in motion the mining of hundreds of thousands blocks (and counting) we don't understand exactly what happens in these microseconds or the initial conditions that were necessary to spawn them. Hence any human or group of humans would be unwise to think they can entirely control a civilizational new beginning. And yet they would be just as unwise to think they will just wake up one day and expect to see a Third Temple magically sitting on top of the Temple Mount with no human involvement. There were Jews that opposed other Jews returning back to Israel to form a modern day nation state and there will no doubt be Jews that oppose other Jews working towards, one stepping stone at a time, the rebuilding of the Third Temple. But there are two things that are indisputable to any religious G\*d fearing Jew. One, that G\*d wishes the Holy Temple to be rebuilt at some point. And two, that G\*d has from genesis onwards worked through humans to achieve earthly goals. Knowing those two things it is extremely difficult to argue that Jews should not slowly and carefully navigate those stepping stones towards that new beginning.

## 55 Ascending the Temple Mount

To state the obvious for a Third Temple to be built by humans it eventually requires humans to ascend the Temple Mount who intend to build the Third Temple and spend significant amounts of uninterrupted time on it. Leaving the Temple Mount under the control of the Waqf (Islamic religious trust) and imposing no restrictions on Muslims whilst imposing strict restrictions on Jews and non-Muslims do not present the conditions for humans to conscientiously and meticulously remove the Dome of the Rock and begin laying the foundations of a Third Temple. Hence any action from a Jew to push up against those restrictions is imposing a small dent on the infallibility of the status quo. Other than voting for politicians who make Jewish sovereignty over the Temple Mount a key pillar of their platform the most obvious thing a Jew can do to attempt to speed up progress towards a Third Temple is ascend the Temple Mount themselves and pray there. Not all rabbis will permit their congregations to ascend the Temple Mount given its sanctity and the lack of absolute certainty over where exactly the First or Second Temple stood let alone the Holy of Holies and the Ark of the Covenant. But the current status quo of non-Jews trampling these potential sites whilst Jews are discouraged from respectfully praying there under halachic guidelines is surely the worst of both worlds for the Jewish people. It is difficult to see a path towards humans building the Third Temple without normalizing Jews ascending the Temple Mount and praying there to the extent that their rabbis will permit them. The Temple Institute outlines basic guidelines on their website for a Jew (or non-Jew) who seeks to ascend the Temple Mount in purity from a Jewish halachic perspective. It isn't exhaustive as biblical laws of purity are some of the most complex and most intensely debated by rabbis and Torah scholars but it is their best attempt of threading the needle of advancing towards a Third Temple within a framework of reverence to the holiness of the site and best attempt adherence to biblical laws. 

"I entered the Great and Holy House and prayed there, on Thursday, the 6th of the month of Marcheshvan....Just as I merited to pray in its ruins, may I soon see, myself and all Israel, its comfort, speedily - amen!" Maimonides ("The Rambam") 

Maimonides compiled the Laws of the Chosen House in his magnum opus, the Mishneh Torah, fourteen books on Jewish observance and rabbinic Jewish religious law which he wrote in Egypt in the 12th century CE according to the Gregorian calendar. Setting sail from northwest Africa and navigating militant Islamists, Christian Crusaders, pirates and violent storms he was able to arrive at the site of the Chosen House via the port of Akko and pray there, performing the positive commandment of Mora Mikdash. As a 12th century Jewish visitor Maimonides would have required a vivid imagination to picture the Holy Temple in its full glory (Maimonides, Joel Kraemer) and there were none of the signs of promise that present themselves to a 21st century visitor. Today there are signs in the ancient Jewish language to direct you towards the Western Wall (הכותל), security guards with the Star of David on their uniform, a 500 kilogram Golden Menorah for the Third Temple displayed in the Jewish Quarter, a Temple Institute museum and a Second Temple virtual reality (VR) experience. Maimonides would have experienced a site stripped of nearly all signs of Jews and Judaism and yet his Laws of the Chosen House, written in the years following his visit, contain detailed measurements in cubits for the various rooms and courtyards of a future Third Temple. It is difficult to assess what would have shocked him more in the present day. That over 800 years later the Holy Temple still hadn't been rebuilt, that it wasn't a priority for a modern day Jewish nation state or that his Laws of the Chosen House would be instantly accessible on a pocket sized computer to a curious diaspora Jew halfway across the world.

## 56 Back to staring longingly at the wire (Mo' countries, mo' prison guards)

Viktor Frankl described in Man's Search For Meaning how the "wire", an electrically charged barbed wire fence presented a daily opportunity to end the suffering in the concentration camp of Auschwitz. It appears G\*d loves irony. Sitting in modern day Jewish controlled Jerusalem being punished by the halachic Jewish prison guards for the sins of the father and back to staring longingly at the metaphorical wire. You'd think as a patrilineal Jew the Law of Return would be one topic on which I'd disagree with Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich on. In 2022 Ben-Gvir and Smotrich attempted to tighten up the Law of Return so that only halachic Jews, an Orthodox convert or born to a Jewish mother, would have the right to obtain Israeli citizenship. That would rule out individuals like yours truly who rely on the Holocaust inspired "grandchild clause" as their father, like Moses, married outside of the tribe. The reality I as a patrilineal Jew have experienced, and the reality others in my position have supposedly experienced, is that the "grandchild clause" is a sham and when patrilineal Jews are encouraged to take an all expenses paid Birthright trip to Israel under the auspices that they could move to Israel if they wished they are being sold a lie. If you actually attempt to do it you are fed into the Soviet style bureaucracy meat grinder, organizations like the Jewish Agency and Nefesh B'Nefesh refuse to help you and you can waste months or years of your life. If that is the reality then the Law of Return should be updated to align with today's reality and Ben-Gvir, Smotrich were correct yet again to attempt to update it. For what reason other than prison guard style cruelty would you offer a path out of crumbling, increasingly Islamized hellscapes under a pretense? Waste months or years of people's lives for doing nothing wrong other than being born to a parent who made the same mistake as Moses. As I write this I signed up to the Birthright trip six years ago.

I may try again in future if I feel I can afford to throw enough money at Israeli lawyers to solve the problem. Going the legal route under the current Law of Return should ultimately succeed though could entail spiralling costs. I don't trust anyone in a position of responsibility in the UK including UK rabbis to do anything other than lead me down more garden paths to nowhere so pursuing an Orthodox conversion there seems less appealing than the wire. The British establishment, to the extent that it has any coherent position at all as it oversees a national bonfire and sells out national infrastructure and assets to Arabs and the Chinese, is increasingly anti-Israel. Those who can afford to and have a route out of the misery have left or are leaving. I have spent a decade now trying to find an alternative solid base to construct a life from and in that time the UK has gone from merely mediocre to wildly dystopian. The urgency of escaping the whirlpool ramps up year by year and after a decade I'm essentially back to square one. And a decade ago I could engage with strangers and make connections online. Today I seem to be blackholed on all the major online platforms. So if anything I'm back to square minus one. Thanks slimy billionaire snakes like Elon "free speech" Musk.

It is certainly harder to maintain an effective stake or interest in a country after it has rejected you on multiple occasions for not being sufficiently Jewish whilst the Israeli state simultaneously funds programs that insists you are. Especially when you are in a hurry and don't have years to waste. But I stand by everything I've written here. On the backs of the lifetime work of Theodor Herzl, Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Rabbi Meir Kahane and countless others including many whose names will never be mentioned in the history books it really seems like Israel is one collective leap of faith away from making the two millennia of suffering in exile worthwhile. I don't know whether it can make that leap. It is the difference between being locked in permanent cycles of violence with Arab terrorists from within its borders and offering a level of security to its citizens that meets the historic standard (though now slipping) of the West and a platform to start preparing a Third Temple. G\*d willing Ben-Gvir's and Smotrich's political parties make advances in the next election due 2026 at the latest and Israel can finally, finally break the cycle.    

## 57 Where next? Trump's America or the pivot to Asia?

You'd think that after 8 years of having visa and visa waiver applications rejected for the United States and not being able to return since 2017 I'd jump at the chance to visit now a visa waiver has finally been granted allowing me to visit for up to 3 months. Especially in the first year of Trump's second term which effectively is America's historic opportunity to pivot out of the malaise it finds itself in. There are a few things that make me hesitate. One, there appears to be no viable path to citizenship. Two, the Silicon Valley of hacker houses, hackathons and Bitcoin developer meetups that I was barred from in 2017 doesn't seem to exist anymore or they are a pale imitation of what they used to be. Even when I was in California you could see the blight of homelessness, drug addicts and crime rising and it seems to have got far, far worse in the eight years since. The technology ecosystem has splintered to various other American states, none of which can compare to pre 2017 Silicon Valley though Texas seems to be the state where the majority of it has gravitated to. The Marc Andreessens of 2017 were on the search for the next Google or Facebook founder and since they've tried to enrich themselves via s\*\*\*coins, Ponzi schemes and AGI snake oil. The Elon Musks of 2017 were sleeping in Tesla and Space X factories to ensure the most innovative robotics on earth functioned and since he has larped about returning free speech to Twitter and pranced around Trump rallies as if he is the only one in the United States who can cut federal government spending. It has become a freak show. Bitcoin is crying out for an Apple like company to roll out the best in class hardware products like hardware wallets, full nodes and satellites to a mass consumer market and the company that is best placed to do that, Blockstream, continues to disappoint. Three, I fear that the challenges that the United States faces are so deep rooted that Trump and his administration, especially with an eye on Russia/Ukraine, Israel and potentially Taiwan, won't be able to address them without at least a decade in power and inculcating the next generation of Marc Andreessens and Elon Musks who aren't stifled by the current freak show oligopoly of billionaires. Four, I wonder if the 2000s and 2010s world has gone and we've entered a 1930s-1940s period like the post Great Depression and World War 2 era. The global elite billionaire class have done an incredible job of disguising the fact that the purchasing power of the middle class has been subject to a Great Depression level crevice while they have become exponentially wealthier on the backs of them. This can't continue forever and probably needs a World War like event to distract them from the fact that their children's and grandchildren's futures and prospects have been stolen from them. If that is the bigger picture and countries like the United States are just gearing up for war the 2000s and 2010s are gone. Better to hide in a functioning small country and quietly accumulate Bitcoin to the extent that one is able to.

## 58 To be a fake Jew or not to be?

The longer term question as a patrilineal Jew without Israeli citizenship, only visitor rights to Israel and a deep mistrust of the establishment of the UK (both Jewish and non-Jewish) is to what extent I should practise Jewish customs or consider myself in any way Jewish. The problem you have as a patrilineal Jew is in terms of your lineage Judaism potentially dies with you after an ancestral chain spanning millennia of generations assuming no conversions. It is why Rabbi Meir Kahane argued passionately in his "Why Be Jewish?" book against intermarriage and assimilation into foreign cultures and why a friend in Israel told me I was dealing with a generational curse. You are as close to being a halachic Jew as you can be without being one and your children (assuming you have them and their mother isn't Jewish either) will be another step removed and hence even less likely to resume the chain. You can convert but you have to find a rabbi you ideologically align with and is willing to assist you with the conversion process in a country you can spend more than 3 months in at a time. Rabbis can vary wildly both in terms of their denomination (Orthodox, Haredi, Conservative, Reform, Progressive etc), their political views, their views on Zionism and the state of Israel and the extent to which they allow those views to leak into their religious perspectives. UK rabbis from the Chief Rabbis down seem to be of the tame, assimilated, politically correct, don't be too supportive of Israel and pander to the increasingly Islamized British institutions variety. All hostage pins, Palestine two state solutions and not doing anything to upset the Arabs/Muslims in the UK or in Israel. I as a patrilineal Jew or a fake Jew or whatever I am finds this spineless and weaselly. I think the "Why don't you make aliyah?" question is a valid one for any Jew in the diaspora let alone rabbis though there are a number of American rabbis, both living and deceased, who I admire and take much more robust pro-Israel stances and defend Israel's ability to deal with its decades long Arab terrorism problem. As previously discussed the Jewish people's destiny and the biblical promise was for G\*d to "gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been." (Ezekiel 11:17) It is natural that the rabbis in the diaspora who make the jump like Rabbi Meir Kahane are of the more fervent religious Zionist variety and those who stay behind try not to upset the apple cart with the growing Arab/Muslim populations in their adopted homes. There is a self selection bias in that the rabbis in Israel are more likely to align with the views of Kahane or perhaps less controversially "The Rebbe" (The Lubavitcher Rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson) though interestingly he never made aliyah despite being a staunch supporter of Israel and others making aliyah. The rabbis still in the UK are the rabbis who never made the jump to America, the land of opportunity, nor the jump to the Promised Land. It is rather tough for an aspiring Kahanist or Netanyahu, Ben-Gvir supporter to find an appropriate rabbi who will support their conversion in such an environment and not be blocked somewhere along the path by those who disagree with Kahane's flavor of Judaism in favor of the Chief Rabbi's flavor of "don't upset the apple cart" Judaism.

There also feels something almost alien about Jewish communities I've encountered in a similar way to how I feel when I observe the lives of nepo kids (nepotism kids). I worked as a bartender and waiter at Jewish kids' bar mitzvahs at five star hotels in London where tens of thousands of pounds were spent on the most spoilt kids I'd ever seen and I was just thinking "Is this Judaism? Because this is definitely not me." I saw affluent, gated communities siphoned off from the rest of British society to protect them from the "Free Palestine" Islamists but also to protect them from the assimilation into foreign cultures that Kahane worried about. Even sweet, beautiful customs like lighting candles for the weekly Sabbath felt uncomfortable to me. Am I going to light candles in my flat as a single guy living alone? How much does it cost to buy those candles every week? In Israel Jews wear kippahs (yarmulkes) in the gym. Can I do that living out of hostels with limited access to laundry? Then there's the tzitzit or tassels that Orthodox Jews wear on their shirts, the tallit prayer shawls, the requirement to live within walking distance of a synagogue, the need to buy more expensive kosher foods etc. Perhaps I'm not wealthy enough to be an observant orthodox Jew. Perhaps wealth or relative affluence is bestowed by G\*d on Jews and as a black sheep who has exited the tribe I've lost access to lavish Shabbat dinners. Perhaps my life choices of pursuing high risk startup and disruptive technology endeavors in countries I don't have citizenship rights to be in mean I don't also get to be a Jew. Perhaps I'm destined to ultimately fail over and over again attempting to gain permanent access to superior communities whether that be Silicon Valley, Israel or Judaism itself. Maybe I should just convert to Christianity instead. Is that the Western religion for the non-affluent? But then there are the Kahanes, the Ben-Gvirs who don't seem especially wealthy and seem to have much more passion for Israel, Judaism and the Jewish people than the Jewish parents at the London five star hotel bar mitzvahs. Maybe I'm just talking myself out of something because I'm getting bored of failing at everything and bumping up against a bewildering set of human brick walls whatever I attempt to do.

## 59 In G\*d (and the Bitcoin price) we trust?

"In G\*d we trust" is the official motto of the United States. I've always found it indicative how this American motto contrasts to the British national anthem singing "G\*d save the king" as if the king needs to be saved whilst in contrast the Americans trust G\*d. The United States Declaration of Independence mentions G\*d four times whilst the religious Zionists on the formation of the modern day nation state of Israel had to settle for an indirect reference to G\*d in the Israeli Declaration of Independence referring to the "Rock of Israel". Even today, over 70 years on, religious Zionists like Smotrich and Ben-Gvir are fighting to correct that mistake and breathe life into the Israeli secular state. "In G\*d we trust" appears on the reverse of a United States dollar bill, the dollar bills The Rebbe used to hand out every Sunday with the intention that the recipient should give the dollar to charity. Many of these dollar bills have been framed as reminders of the Rebbe's blessings and the importance of charity whilst others circulate online markets for "Rebbe dollars" (onedollarbillrabbi.com). Since the Rebbe started giving out one dollar bills in the 1980s dollar bills have lost approximately 70 percent of their value or at least those that weren't distributed by the Rebbe have. There is a positive commandment of tzedakah (צדקה) in Judaism to give to charity and in Temple times Jewish farmers set the precedent of giving 10 percent of their produce to charity. Maybe after a decade of dipping in and out of poverty and staring into the abyss I can afford to trust G\*d and the Bitcoin price and just follow the signposts without prioritizing resolving intractable long term questions like citizenship and religious conversion. If the door to Israel closes, for the year at least, and the door to America is finally open after 8 years maybe it is time to ditch the angst and check out the beginnings of Trump's America.

## 60 Ascending the Temple Mount (Part 2)

Maimonides and his family fled persecution in their native town of Cordoba, first to Fez before eventually settling near Cairo. It is unclear how he'd have managed to get legalized documents and proof of Jewish heritage from his hometown under today's Law of Return. It may not have mattered as Jews who have converted to another religion are not eligible to immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return and it is possible that Maimonides converted to Islam in order to escape danger or death. He wrote a letter when he was not yet thirty years old discussing forced conversion and whether martyrdom was preferable to feigning belief in Islamic tenets such as recognizing Muhammad as a prophet of G\*d (Conversion to Islam in the Premodern Age, Hurvitz, Sahner, Simonsohn, Yarbrough). It is unclear whether he immersed himself in a mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath, prior to ascending the Temple Mount as Jews are advised to do today and whether he wore a kippah or any other sign of his Judaism. On my visit I was planning on wearing a kippah and praying but I was advised by a security guard to keep my kippah in my bag if I wanted to walk around the Temple Mount unaccompanied. I saw a group of Jews accompanied by security guards reading Jewish prayers from their phones but I don't think they were allowed to walk around the higher level where the Dome of the Rock stands and where Muslims and I walked. I'm not sure if that was because of Waqf (Islamic religious trust) restrictions or because of the relative sanctity of the higher level, with the Foundation Stone at the center of the Dome of the Rock being the place Jews believe the creation of the world began, the place Abraham was prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac and the most likely location of the Holy of Holies in Temple times. The security guards didn't want me to get too close to the supervised Jewish group and one ushered me away which I once again appreciated the irony of. It is a confusing and disorientating place not only due to my status as an already disorientated patrilineal, fake or crypto Jew but because in the only Jewish state and in the holiest place of that Jewish state the Jews that aren't dissuaded by their rabbi against visiting recite Jewish prayers to a large golden monument of Islam. You just have to remind yourself of the progress that has been made to allow Jews to safely visit and pray there at all and that the direction of travel, unlike in say the UK and Europe, is slow yet promising. But it is like having a Buddha statue at the center of the world's largest mosque or Christian church. It is a jarring distraction and expression of Islamic conquest which proves fiendishly difficult to remove due to opposition from everyone from Jewish rabbis to Muslims themselves. Only the commencement of building the Third Temple will indicate a permanent Jewish presence in Jerusalem rather than a merely transient one.

## 61 Analyzing oneself as a distressed asset

In the financial world investing in or acquiring underperforming, distressed assets can be lucrative if underneath the redundant product lines, bloated layers of middle management and history of failed acquisitions exists a viable long term business or two. You have to identify and wind down the sunk costs without also removing potential profit centers and sources of value for the stripped out businesses so it can be a challenging enterprise. Like a cancer surgeon you want to remove the cancer without removing too much healthy tissue along with it. Fail to remove the cancer comprehensively, the patient still has cancer. Remove too much healthy tissue and the patient might not survive or have a good quality of life going forward. When analyzing oneself as a distressed asset there's a lot I wouldn't want to remove. Fluent speaker and mother tongue of English, the global lingua franca thanks to the legacy of the British and American Empires. A British accent that absurdly still signals competence and authority despite a shrunken empire and a collapsing, mediocre modern day nation state. A bachelor's and master's degree in arguably the most useful STEM subject for the 21st century with the possible exception of computer science or electrical engineering from a British institution which at least when I completed it was recognized as one of the say, top five, in the country for that subject. A MBA abroad in Australia that although certainly not a Harvard or Stanford level institution still gave me an insight into the fastest growing continent in the world (Asia) from a comfortably familiar Western base without the accompanying price tag of a Harvard or Stanford. Ten thousand hours spent studying and working in finance and risk and another ten thousand hours spent studying and working on Bitcoin, possibly the best performing (but technically complex) emerging asset ever. Spending the best part of two years in California absorbing as much as I could about Silicon Valley and the startup ecosystem within the constraint of only being granted temporary access via a visa waiver. You wouldn't want to swap out or remove that or perceive any of that as a sunk cost. And yet.

What I didn't understand when I was younger and what they certainly don't teach you at non-elite British schools is how limited the space you're allowed and able to freely operate in. One of many things I like(d) about Israel was how relatively open and transparent it was about the role played by intelligence agencies, the military and highly selective intelligence units like Unit 8200 in Israeli society. Whether it is the compulsory military service or the multitude of security threats posed to the state it is as if Israel can't afford the delusions or levels of fear and mistrust that I have either experienced or observed in the UK and US. In the UK the vast majority of the society is under the delusion enforced by the media that the military-industrial complex barely exists and only steps in in extreme scenarios. GCHQ on its own ignoring MI5, MI6 organizations etc has an Apple style campus in Cheltenham housing thousands of employees and yet it is extremely rare you hear what they are up to in the media and the general public consciousness is that it barely exists. Meanwhile in the US the military-industrial complex seems to be perceived, most likely accurately, as extremely powerful and something to be feared. I remember asking about the role played by Unit 8200 at an Israeli startup event and the American visitors reacted as if I was asking for the nuclear codes. The reason this is important and relevant is if the most cutting edge, advanced technology is rolled out by spin-offs from the intelligence services and you know this you can get a better gauge of what is possible for individuals who never experienced these career tracks. It is kind of like starting to learn golf as a teenager hoping to become a professional and never finding out that Tiger Woods was being trained by his father to play golf from 6 months old, featured in Golf Digest at 5 years old and was completing pressurized training drills risking his father's safety as a child. Once you learn that you moderate what you think you might be capable of. Similarly from its founding Silicon Valley has been deeply embedded in the military-industrial complex and one would think many of the rags to riches tales (or parents' garages to campuses measuing in the acres) would also have military-industrial complex fingerprints on them. Certainly the censorship of the conventional Jack Dorsey outright banning variety or the more creative Elon Musk algorithmic supression variety would have their fingerprints all over them. I used to think it was possible I could be part of the next Facebook story. Now I wonder if it is possible to send an email, tweet or message to its intended recipient. 

If I was a budding Osama Bin Laden or Yahya Sinwar it would make more sense to me. But whether it be the US, Israel or Bitcoin I seem to be pretty ideologically aligned with where the effective leadership is taking it and I'm certainly not a threat in any way. I'm just trying to work out if it is possible for me to craft a role for myself within the existing paradigm. With Bitcoin I spent months delivering what the effective leadership wanted and was treated afterwards as if I was the Bitcoin Osama Bin Laden. With Israel I have been trying over and over again to get citizenship that I'm supposedly entitled to under the Law of Return and I'm treated as if I'm Yayha Sinwar (not quite, I've lived to tell the tale). I'm deliberately picking communities and countries I support who seemingly have more than enough space for people like me and yet I'm hitting my head against a brick wall. The UK would more than happily swap someone like me for an uneducated, non English speaking Pakistani slum resident so it isn't as if my country of birth wants or needs me for anything other than perhaps to stem the general trend of natives emigrating. It is very hard to pick up any lessons from these experiences for future attempts to ingratiate myself within other communities or countries and hence even whether I should try. The more bewildering it becomes the more I come back to the Richter rat experiment and the answer resting above Richter in the hands of G\*d but my attempts to ingratiate myself in the Judaism community have proved just as unsuccessful. I feel like a distressed asset with turnaround potential but all the external signs are that I'm a distressed asset with next to no redeemable features. 

It is hard to tell currently if the years spent on Bitcoin are a sunk cost. I'm certainly open to the possibility that they may be at this point. Working on the activation of a major Bitcoin upgrade (Taproot) and getting caught in its aftermath was the poisoned chalice from hell. Up until that point I had poured hours on end into various Bitcoin projects with zero remuneration (Bitcoin StackExchange, Bitcoin Transcripts, Bitcoin Core PR review club, London Bitcoin Devs meetup etc) and watched as others were given funding and full time mentorship with next to no prior contributions to anything Bitcoin related. I didn't make a fuss though and built up a network, positive reputation and what would probably be considered political capital in other more conventional industries. But Taproot activation and its aftermath blew that away with no upside to me personally. The metaphorical mines that didn't blow up trying to shepherd through Taproot activation blew up trying to explain to people who really should have known better that that kind of major upgrade couldn't just be repeated over and over again with no community buy-in. After that all the political capital I had built up over years had evaporated and the time I could have spent making uncontroversial, conventional, minor code contributions to a software project had instead effectively been wasted on something that was critically important to Bitcoin but conveyed zero personal benefit, either to my career progression or my Bitcoin holdings. There are a number of ways you can get frozen out even on a open source project that supposedly anyone can make contributions to and can open pull requests to. The obvious one is funding and mentorship. The in-crowd are given copious amounts of funding and mentorship so they not only can dedicate more time to their contributions but they can be guided so they don't waste time on subprojects that will never get merged. Whilst the out-crowd are stuck asking questions in public forums that the long term contributors can choose to not answer based on who is asking the question, the in-crowd can ask questions in private leaving no public trail for anyone else to benefit from. This effective hoarding of information and sources of potential learning compounds the benefits to the in-crowd. They become more and more critical to the project because of what they've mentally hoarded and no one else has access to. Hence their funding continues to ramp up because the project becomes more and more dependent on them and less dependent on the out-crowd because the out-crowd's learning is public. The larp is that it is an effective meritocracy when in reality it operates more like any for-profit organization or company with some having access to the long term contributors and some not. Or at least it does today, the early years dynamic seemed to be very different and much closer to the idealized perception though I wasn't around then. The open source project Linux seems to have managed to avoid falling into these traps but again I have minimal experience of the Linux community and suspect that it succeeds through the force of personality and ruthless, brutally honest public critiques from its creator Linus Torvalds. Bitcoin has no benevolent dictator for life and this probably contributes to it surrendering to the in-crowd, out-crowd dynamics and private discussions that the out-crowd are locked out of.

I suspect my experience would be very useful in the event of another major Bitcoin upgrade (or consensus rule change) getting community buy-in or in the nightmare scenario of another contentious upgrade attempt kicking off a consensus rule war like was experienced with the block size war that culminated in 2017 or the one that nearly happened in 2022. But just hanging around doing unpaid work for years and struggling away in the out-crowd until one of those things happen doesn't sound like an optimal career strategy. There's no guarantee I wouldn't also be frozen out of any future upgrade especially when struggling with online shadowbans and suppressed freedom of reach. And honestly if I'm not needed in such a scenario I would rather not do it again. It wasn't enjoyable and didn't convey any personal benefits whatsoever apart from exhaustion and loss of brain cells. The one potential future route is that I'm convinced that like Linux has distributions and Linus Torvalds looks after the central kernel Bitcoin will have at least one and potentially multiple widely used distributions. Technically these would be forks of the Bitcoin Core Git repository that make changes around the periphery of the codebase without falling out of consensus with Bitcoin Core and setting off another consensus rule war. They wouldn't diverge too far from the Bitcoin Core codebase lest they are unable to benefit from the ongoing work and code that is merged into Bitcoin Core. The other potential Bitcoin career alternatives, either Blockstream taking itself seriously as a business and a potential Apple for Bitcoin, or Blockstream's Lightning implementation taking itself seriously and attempting to obtain serious market share, don't seem viable with the current leadership priorities.

Assuming I wrote years working on Bitcoin off as a sunk cost what would I focus on instead? At a push maybe I have one last roll of the dice where I can completely engross myself in a field I currently know very little about whilst my mind is still relatively fresh and malleable. Relative being the operative word. I'm certainly no Tiger Woods kid performing golf drills with his father but I'm not at President Trump's age or Warren Buffett's age either. If I had to bet my one last roll of the dice in 2025 on one particular technical field which would it be? Artificial intelligence is certainly interesting, improving and overlaps with my mathematical training. However, it is currently obscenely overhyped by the AGI clowns: Sam Altman and Elon Musk etc. If I've learnt anything from my professional life so far is that the fish rots from the head down. If the direction and the priorities set by the leadership isn't grounded in a deep understanding of what currently works and how it is working they can hallucinate all kinds of science fiction scenarios to collect large checks from dumb investors but it is going to endlessly frustrate and deflect the attention of the actual scientists and technologists working under them towards propping up the hallucination. Apple made a better computer, Tesla made a better car, Space X made a better rocket. No human ever made and ever will make a better G\*d. The three technical fields that are absolute no brainers are military technology (both hardware and software), cyber security and semiconductor chips. Wars and skirmishes between nation states and terrorist groups aren't going anywhere (unfortunately). Unless Israel has a complete political meltdown it needs to secure and defend itself from internal attacks in Gaza, Judea and Samaria and external attacks from Arab nation states. Unless Taiwan ships out all its semiconductor fabrication facilities and expertise externally so that the Americans don't have an interest in its future, Taiwan will need to secure itself from China. Singapore's geographic location and size means it can't afford to rest on its laurels. And then Russia/Ukraine and recently India/Pakistan show that even the much larger nation states are starting to flex their military muscles and act much more aggressively. If it isn't World War 3 it is arguably the most volatile time since World War 2. To be long (bet on rather than against) military technology seems as much a no brainer as being long Bitcoin. Even in a best case scenario of overnight Trump induced world peace very few will be stupid enough to go all-in on it enduring for very long.

With today's technology there has never been a better time in human history for small nation and city states like Israel, Taiwan and Singapore to protect themselves from internal terrorists and much larger, more densely populated neighbors. It certainly still isn't easy but unlike tiny numbers of Jews trying to fend off the Romans two millennia ago or Genghis Khan maruading his way through Asia in the 12th century CE today it is not exclusively a numbers game. Nuclear weapons have made it possible to wipe out a small nation state in minutes though the logic of mutually assured destruction, especially if superpowers are drawn in, and no guarantee that a larger nation state has access to more powerful nuclear weapons, defense systems and alert systems than a highly competent, smaller nation state ensures the benefits don't necessarily accrue to the larger nation state. If a rogue dictator decides to fire a nuclear weapon there is no guarantee that it will fire at all, won't be blown out the sky before leaving his country's airspace or worse detonates in his own face. Cyber attacks such as Stuxnet, speculated to be conducted by the Americans and/or Israelis in Iran in 2010 are able to disable centrifuges, and more recently the pager supply chain attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon show that vulnerabilities can lurk for many years in any part of your infrastructure or communications systems. In some sense nuclear warfare resembles the game theory of Bitcoin's consensus system in that whoever is most competent and penetrated into the deepest part of the system will end up winning. But if the most competent gets complacent or fails to subtly communicate its superiority the lesser competent parties can be lulled into thinking they are more competent than they actually are. Ultimately the majority will defer to the most competent because they want to be on the winning side assuming they can assess who the most competent is. In a world of nuclear weapons there can only be one most competent party just like in Bitcoin there can only be one set of consensus rules. The consensus rules can be changed relatively safely in a long, arduous process with majority buy-in but can't be changed unilaterally especially without the buy-in of the most competent.

If you had to design a nation state from the top down that would be uniquely exposed to cyber attacks you'd struggle to do better than the UK today. Sitting out the internet revolution and outsourcing the building of multibillion dollar companies to the US whilst any attempts to build domestic competitors are founded by wealthy, nepo kids who think they can outsource the building of high quality software to poorly paid Asian contractors. An education system that prioritizes humanities and PPE (Politics, Philosophy and Economics) degrees for their elites whilst the rest of the population wallows in a state school system tuned to maximize the lowest common denominator and attempting to integrate third world immigrants. Intelligence services that have prioritized "diversity" over building institutions that are capable of working with British industry to ensure they aren't repeatedly crippled for long periods by cyber attacks. A capital city that still has large amounts of wealth flowing through it due to the legacy of the British Empire and turning a blind eye to foreign political leaders plundering the wealth of the nation states they have dominion over. And a ruling class that still acts under the self-important delusion that it is overseeing a large empire rather an increasingly impoverished, small nation state. It isn't ideal to outsource a key pillar of modern day national security to foreign companies like Palantir (US) or Check Point (Israel) and foreign intelligence services even if they are allies but after decades of mismanagement and failure to prioritize the critical skillsets and expertise of the 21st century the UK doesn't have much choice. My conspiratorial mind wonders if the UK has been set up by the Americans to be the easy target battleground where the Americans can monitor or assess the cyber capabilities of superpower competitors like Russia and China. But it could very well exclusively be a matter of incompetence and complacency on the part of the British. The US Vice President JD Vance has publicly speculated that the UK could be the "first Islamist country with nuclear weapons". It is certainly possible that after the Iranian nuclear program threat is dealt with that the next concern for Israel and the Middle East emerges from Europe. 

"In total, it takes over a dozen semiconductors to make a smartphone work, with different chips managing the battery, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular network connections, audio, the camera and more. Apple makes precisely none of these chips. It buys most off-the-shelf: memory chips from Japan's Kioxia, radio frequency chips from California's Skyworks, audio chips from Cirrus Logic, based in Austin, Texas. Apple designs in-house the ultra-complex processors that run an iPhone's operating system. But the Cupertino, California, colossus can't manufacture these chips. Nor can any company in the United States, Europe, Japan, or China. Today, Apple's most advanced processors - which are arguably the world's most advanced semiconductors - can only be produced by a single company in a single building, the most expensive factory in human history" Chris Miller (Chip War)

Of the three most promising technical fields I've identified (military technology, cyber security and semiconductor chips) semiconductor chips would perhaps be the most guarded and delicate of the three. Obviously there is a subset of military technology that includes nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon defense systems that would be the most guarded of all but the majority of it from drones to robotics to Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system (or the US' planned Golden Dome excluding nuclear components) wouldn't be highly classified and could be put out to tender on the open market. Due to commercial intellectual property, geopolitical sensitivity and the most meticulous of cleanliness standards to avoid contamination an unemployed British guy with ideas above his station would struggle to roam around the most expensive factory in human history in Taiwan in an attempt to learn about the semiconductor chip industry. One essentially has to accept from the outset that one won't be able to learn about the most cutting edge of chip fabrication without some of the highest clearance from the Taiwanese authorities and if that is the thing standing between them and Chinese invasion you can hardly blame them. Even if you're willing to make that concession it isn't as if there will be an open door policy at chip fabrication plants elsewhere including TSMC's future factory in Arizona, announced amidst a threat of tariffs by President Trump to every trade partner including Taiwan. It gives trying to compete with Tiger Woods as a untrained teenager vibes as you'd probably need an entry point provided by intelligence services and/or garner trust by working your way up from graduate or postgraduate entry level over multiple decades.

When you're in the out-crowd or out-group, relative to the in-crowd or in-group, you are effectively searching for a blind spot that the in-crowd has, a skillset or a willingness to complete tasks that the in-crowd is unable or unwilling to do, and crucially that you are able to convince the in-crowd that this blind spot exists. With the activation of the Bitcoin consensus rule change (Taproot soft fork) it was blatantly obvious that those with the most technical brilliance didn't want to touch it. Whatever the reason was, still fatigued by the block size war years before, perceiving it as beneath them and/or unimportant or identifying that it didn't align with their skillset, the topic drifted in and out of the weekly developer IRC (Internet Relay Chat) meeting without anyone seizing the initiative. It didn't do me any good in the long run but it ticked the box of identifying a blind spot and convincing the in-crowd that the blind spot existed. Latter attempts to convince the in-crowd that there were challenges with scaling developer teams, weak project management and poor communication to the wider community fell on deaf ears. It didn't help that the few project managers there were didn't seem to have a strong enough technical understanding to engage in technical discussions and this contributed to the skepticism that project management could add any value. In addition, having this potential nuclear war threat at the heart of the technical community and always having half a mind on another potential consensus rule war made me suspect that the effective leaders with technical brilliance would happily settle for dysfunctional project management, poor communication and developer teams that didn't scale if it meant minimizing the risk of another consensus rule war. It could very well be that these apparent flaws were as developers like to say "not a bug but a feature". Does this explain Blockstream product lines and projects underperforming? Perhaps. Though I suspect technically brilliant, cypherpunk minds not being able to perceive of blind spots and not seeing the value of an Andy Grove to Intel's initial co-founders Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce played a part too. I'm not deluded or conceited enough to think I was ever in the same league as Andy Grove (author of Only The Paranoid Survive and High Output Management and general Silicon Valley visionary) but you need the Moores and Noyces to be able to comprehend their blind spots for the out-crowd to stand a chance at propelling their companies and projects forward. Whether it is deliberate or not Bitcoin's Moores and Noyces have yet to do so.

## 62 Only the paranoid (and ambitious?) survive

This essentially gets to the crux of the challenge I'm facing and what will determine whether I'm able to look back on my life with any sort of pride to what I've achieved and any kind of feeling that I maximized the potential that G\*d (or Mother Nature if you're less religiously inclined) gave me. Whether it be citizenship (Israel, US, Singapore, Taiwan etc) and/or industry (Bitcoin, semiconductor chips, cybersecurity etc) can I identify blind spots in the effective leadership and even more crucially can I convince the effective leadership that those blind spots exist? The bigger the vision of the effective leadership the easier this is to do. If the leader(s)' primary objective is to maintain a small prison cell and he has thousands of staff to do it it is very possible that no obvious blind spots exist. However, if the vision is to build a civilization on Mars or the world's first ever continent sized missile defense system or attract the smartest, most ambitious human capital from around the world to your country to maintain your edge in semiconductor chips there are going to be blind spots or in more optimistic terms space for all kinds of different skillsets to thrive. Citizenship has to come first as it is essentially a declaration that I will work in that country's interests and not against them. It doesn't necessarily open up the entire TSMC factory for me to roam around but it at least moves me out of the tourist category bracket and gives a reason for the in-crowd to speak to me.

"Silicon Valley in the late 1960s was already teeming with technical geniuses. What it lacked were leaders who could transform those geniuses into cohesive, productive teams... What is significant here is Grove's intuitive understanding of complementary skills. While others sought to duplicate their strengths in founding teams Grove recognized that Moore and Noyce needed someone fundamentally different from themselves. They had vision, they had technical credibility but what they lacked was operational discipline. Grove didn't need to be another visionary inventor. Instead he took the role of execution specialist who could transform brilliant ideas into reality." Shane Parrish (Knowledge Project)

At a time when visa and immigration schemes in the Western world are being gamed for low skilled, low paid work (or worse criminality) and native populations are being swamped with third world migrants the value that a certain kind of immigrant can bring gets overlooked. Silicon Valley (and the US itself centuries prior) would have been a pale imitation without the contribution of smart, ambitious and often desperate immigrants. Andy Grove acquired his paranoia as a Hungarian Jew escaping the Nazis and without a route to the US Intel and Silicon Valley would have been deprived of billions of dollars and a visionary leader. Also strip out the contributions of immigrants like Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Max Levchin (PayPal, Affirm), Sergey Brin (Google), Patrick Collison (Stripe) and Steve Jobs who had immigrant parents and you start to appreciate the value the right kind of immigrants can bring to a highly skilled ecosytem, a nation's economy and a nation's technological competitiveness. It isn't that a population of over 300 million doesn't already contain enough brainpower, it is that immigrants come with characteristics that aren't necessarily inculcated when you have grown up in the world's pre-eminent superpower. Whether that is Grove's paranoia, Musk's work ethic sleeping on the factory floor, Steve Jobs' seemingly maniacal search for perfection or Peter Thiel's contrarianism that led him to support President Trump in 2016 at peak Trump demonization in Silicon Valley, immigrants can bring an outsider perspective and an ability to identify and rectify blind spots in the native population.

## 63 Jerusalem Day: The march of progress against the tide

"The Temple Mount is in our hands. Repeat. The Temple Mount is ours." General Mordechai Gur (1967)

I took the day off agonizing over seemingly intractable citizenship and career questions to experience Jerusalem Day in 2025 (Hebrew year 5785). Jerusalem Day is an Israeli national holiday to celebrate the reunification of Jerusalem under Jewish control following the Six Day War of 1967. At a time when the Israeli army was much weaker (and smaller) than it is today Israel fought off attacks from a coalition of Arab states including Egypt, Syria and Jordan and miraculously emerged victorious with land gains of East Jerusalem including the Temple Mount, the Golan Heights, the West Bank (Judea and Samaria), the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. After such a comprehensive victory in such a short space of time, no doubt with an element of divine intervention, how on earth over 50 years later is Israeli sovereignty over these lands still up for debate and why are there still terrorist attacks emanating from these regions? Israel must have lost wars in subsequent years and been forced to surrender some of this territory right? Bizarrely and emphatically no. Instead whether it was the Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan prohibiting Jews from praying on the Temple Mount in the immediate aftermath of the Six Day War victory with administrative control eventually handed to the Waqf Muslim religious trust or Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordering the dismantling of Israeli settlements in Gaza and withdrawing in 2005 somehow without being defeated by an external enemy, Jews have managed to defeat themselves. There's no doubt an alternative historical timeline floating around somewhere in the universe where this day led to a successful Kahanist movement eradicating terrorism within Israel's borders and granting Jews the rights you would expect them to have at their holiest site if indeed the Temple Mount was as General Mordechai Gur suggested "ours". But on this timeline I was wandering around Jerusalem over 50 years later amongst a sea of Israeli flags and vast crowds of joyful Israelis singing and dancing whilst the Israeli and international media were reporting it as "Far-right marchers attack Palestinians as Israel marks taking of Jerusalem" (BBC), "Thousands of Israelis join violent, racist march through Jerusalem's Muslim quarter" (Guardian) and "Riots, racist slurs, religious ecstasy" (Haaretz). It is utterly, utterly shameless but what do you expect the enemy to do? They can't win an actual war so they flood the media with oil money in the hope of winning a propaganda war. If I was in their position I would do exactly the same thing. But if you were in the Israeli position you don't leave a vacuum to be filled by your enemies, you don't follow up emphatic military victories with weak political surrenders and you don't expect to be able to convince a media reporter to not engage in laughable propaganda when his salary and livelihood depends on doing so. Just like my trip to the Temple Mount I was filled with conflicting emotions but as I write this I can feel my anger and indignation rising at how Israel's brave warriors and fighters have repeatedly been let down and left in the cold by weak political leadership. And at how thousands of Israeli civilians have to be slaughtered in order to correct the wrongs of the past. Time for a coffee. 

Having caffeinated and feeling a little calmer and more charitable perhaps I am judging historical decisions too harshly. Perhaps it wasn't viable to adminster the Temple Mount in the aftermath of comprehensive victory in Six Day War. Perhaps Arab deportations weren't diplomatically palatable in 2005 and without them the costs of defending Jewish settlements in Gaza were too high both in terms of military resources and Jewish blood spilt. Perhaps. Regardless opportunities for a step change in policy and strategy don't come around very often. Undoubtedly declaring victory in the Six Day War was such an opportunity. Experiencing the groundswell of patriotism and solidarity on the Jerusalem Day flag march reinforced a view that I already held, that post the terrorist attacks of October 7th presents a similar opportunity and perhaps one I won't see again in my lifetime. The Temple Mount "status quo" hasn't changed since the culmination of the Six Day War. After a step change status quos tend to last much longer than their protagonists intended. So time to check in on the potential present day protagonists, what were they up to on Jerusalem Day? To be fair exactly what they should be doing. Itamar Ben-Gvir prayed on the Temple Mount in the morning with other politicians and advisors ignoring the inevitable statement to emerge from the Prime Minister's Office that status quo prohibitions on Jewish prayer haven't changed. His advisor, Yishai Fleisher, filmed himself prostrating and praying at the Temple Mount no doubt attracting the ire of both status quo proponents and Jewish rabbis who believe the site is too sacred for Jews to visit let alone film themselves doing so. In the afternoon Ben-Gvir addressed adoring crowds, distributing stickers and clasping the hands of wellwishers in a style only Ben-Gvir can. I spotted Moshe Feiglin speaking to attendees under an erected pop-up gazebo and Bezalel Smotrich speaking to masses of people at the Western Wall. Despite what the media said it was everything they said it wasn't. Peaceful, optimistic, joyful, patriotic if way too crowded to trudge round the walls of the Old Town. But I'm sure the culmination of the Six Day War felt the same. Opportunities for step changes not only are rare, after a period of time they expire. Then the status quo holds for decades until the next mass slaughter of Jews potentially presents another one. You pray that today's cast of characters can deliver on the declaration made by General Mordechai Gur over fifty years ago, that the Temple Mount is "ours" and what happens to it and in the land encircling it is entirely the responsibility of the Jews governing it with the help of Hashem. Will they show the unwavering and unyielding faith Abraham showed on the foundation stone when G\*d asked him to sacrifice his son? Or will they too fall into the pit of compromise after compromise and surrender to the swarm of noise generated by the enemy's seemingly endless supply of oil money? Will this generation rebuild the Temple or will it be as if this generation destroyed it?  

## 64 Patrick Bateman in Tel Aviv

"There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there." Patrick Bateman (American Psycho)

After years of knocking my head against a metaphorical brick wall with various UK rabbis and the Jewish Agency I finally have a Proof of Judaism letter from a UK rabbi stating that I am a patrilineal Jew. In theory that means there is nothing to prevent me completing the aliyah process. Assuming no further unanticipated setbacks that means I can start planning a life in Israel rather than pursuing a highly speculative path to citizenship in a Singapore or a Taiwan or accepting a nomadic existence with no right to stay in a country other than the UK for more than 90 days. After such a long time one would think I would be if not euphoric then at least relieved. For now at least, whether it is the metaphorical concussion or my immune system preparing me for the seemingly inevitable setback or nausea for the years wasted at an age I couldn't afford to waste them I'm feeling pretty Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. I certainly have gratitude; gratitude for the Israeli sun hitting my skin in the morning after a long winter of Vitamin D deficiency, gratitude for all the Jews (and non-Jews) who have built (and funded) this nation state from the ground up within a century, gratitude for the young Israelis in army uniform I see on the bus in the morning for putting their lives at risk to defend what has been built. The city I am now sipping coffee in, Tel Aviv, has only existed for just over a century with its founding in 1909. Today it is Israel's second most populous city, the primary driver of Israel's technological economy, the fourth most significant startup ecosystem in the world and as graffiti scrawled on a nearby wall states "New New York". An appropriate place to connect with my inner Manhattan based Patrick Bateman. Following Theodor Herzl's Altneuland (Old New Land) Jerusalem represents the old and Tel Aviv represents the new. Just like the Old Testament needs a New Testament and vice versa, Jerusalem needs Tel Aviv and vice versa. The old needs the new to try new things, to generate wealth out of nothing, to build a modern, future looking city that funds the preservation of the old. You could argue that building the Third Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem would be something new but in reality it is just reverting back to what was. For whatever reason previous temples were unable to be preserved and hence a restoration is required to preserve what was the focal point of Jewish religious and spiritual life. There isn't a dearth of modernity in Jerusalem, nor is there a total absence of spirituality in Tel Aviv but Jerusalem will never beat Tel Aviv for its newness nor will Tel Aviv ever beat Jerusalem for its oldness. An alternative new Israeli city could theoretically rise to trump Tel Aviv but it is hard to see another city in the world ever trumping Jerusalem. There is a weight to preserving the old and although in Jerusalem's case that weight is certainly worthwhile there is a lightness and a kind of lifting of that weight when you can start from scratch in building and experiencing modernity.

In many ways the established and aspiring Israeli cities, excluding Jerusalem, are living in their American equivalent's shadows. Whether it is Tel Aviv as New New York, Haifa as a kind of new San Francisco Bay Area built around the Technion university as a new Stanford University, or Eilat as a possible new Los Angeles the American cities have set the benchmark in the 20th century for what is possible for technology, education and the creative arts. I don't think it is my Americanized mind trying to enforce templates I'm familiar with on new things that could very well evolve into things that don't have previous equivalents though there is perhaps an element of that. I don't mean to denigrate either. I am not writing off the American originals in the 21st century, nor am I saying that the Israeli equivalents are destined to live in their American equivalent's shadows forever. Forces well above my pay grade will determine what happens in the 21st century and beyond. Going back to the grandparent, parent, child analogy it is unfair and foolish to write off children currently living in their parents' shadow when they are still children. There was a time of course too when America was the young child living in the British Empire's shadow and American cities, universities and ecosystems were started based on British blueprints. The original New York had an original York. Harvard and MIT universities are based in the American equivalent of Cambridge. They ended up taking on a life of their own and today you can't argue that New York is living in York's shadow or Harvard and MIT are living in Cambridge University's shadow. Again not denigrating York or the British Cambridge. The key differences of course between Israel in the 21st century and the United States in say the 19th century are their relative sizes and their religions and ethnicities. The United States was inheriting a vast land mass and Israel (at least today, wink to the Greater Israel advocates) is the size of New Jersey. Although neither the United States nor Israel have an official state religion and enshrined freedom of religion into their effective constitutions, the United States was primarily built by Christians and according to Christian (arguably Judeo-Christian) principles and Israel was primarily built by Jews and according to Jewish principles. With a global Jewish population of approximately 15 million today and the friction involved in Jewish conversions even a Greater Israel wouldn't be able to fill a United States sized land mass in the Middle East with Jews assuming it wanted to despite the Haredi's best efforts at child rearing (Haredi Jews today average 6-7 children per woman.) So at least in the 21st century and 22nd centuries Israel isn't going to be a replacement of the United States, nor is it going to outgrow it in terms of population and land mass. Culturally and creative arts wise, the Hebrew language also isn't going to replace the English language as the lingua franca. But it is possible that individual cities and ecosystems in Israel grow from out from their American equivalent's shadows and eventually outperform them. It isn't inevitable, it will depend on how the American and Israeli equivalents perform, but it isn't impossible that an area around the Technion university could eventually compete as a technology ecosystem with the San Francisco Bay Area or Harvard and MIT's Cambridge, Massachusetts. Size of course isn't everything either. Discarding the Hebrew language in Israeli arts for example trying to chase a global audience could very well be perceived as a cost not worth paying.

I also suspect that just like New York was the primary location for offboarding and processing new American immigrants under the gaze of the Statue of Liberty Tel Aviv as New New York has been and will continue to be the place new Jewish immigrants choose to initially settle in Israel. It is expensive which will price many out but for those who are used to a more secular lifestyle, whose Hebrew isn't yet up to scratch and need English speaking synagogues and/or those who are coming from denominations of Judaism other than Orthodox and Haredi (denominations such as Reform that are popular in the United States but aren't recognized by Orthodox Judaism) Tel Aviv is probably a better initial fit than Jerusalem. As someone who is more politically aligned with Jerusalem than Tel Aviv I personally hope that the political center of gravity remains Jerusalem. Synagogues all over the world are built to face Jerusalem rather than an alternative Israeli city and I don't think this orientation should change from within Israel. Population dynamics are a delicate issue though and much more delicate than they ever seemed to be in the United States. The primary concern of course is Jewish, Arab demographics as a Jewish state with a majority Arab population or even a significant minority Arab population wouldn't stay Jewish for very long. But even within the Jewish population how that Jewish identity evolves over time will have far reaching impacts on the nation state and its political decision making and direction. An overnight addition of say 5 million Reform, liberal minded Jews (not that this would ever happen) would be a boon for the political parties on the left side of the spectrum. Similarly a dearth of immigrants to somewhat balance out the exponentially increasing Haredi population would pose fiscal and defense challenges assuming the Haredi population continues to be subsidized by the non Haredi taxpayer and defended by non Haredi Israeli soldiers. Although it is controversial I suspect it is inevitable in the long term that this isn't fiscally or militarially sustainable and regardless of the immigration numbers the Haredi will have to integrate more into broader Israeli society, generate income to contribute to the state and join their non-Haredi brethren to serve in the army. Whether that happens now or later is uncertain but longer term it can only go one way if the the Israeli state is to avoid bankruptcy and/or much higher taxation burdens and vast swathes of military service exemptions.

As you age you gradually forget the role places and people played in shaping your life, beliefs and thought processes. Your memories, daily emotions and reactions to previous novelties become less vivid and gradually dissolve into your psyche. It has (only) been six years since I first stepped foot in Israel but wandering around Tel Aviv and seeing places that I remember seeing and experiencing for the first time like the Bitcoin Embassy and the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation teleports me back to a time before the October 7th terrorist attacks and Covid pandemic lockdowns. To an observable extent these have stunted the growth of the city at least economically. Six years ago the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation with its virtual reality space exhibition, screen interactions with prominent Israeli entrepreneurs and Shimon Peres videos from beyond the grave imploring visitors to "Dream big" was like nothing I had ever experienced even in America. Today I am almost scared to return to it partly because I feel like a totally different person to when I first visited and partly because at the time it was too perfect. With significant tourist disruptions from the Covid pandemic and post October 7th wars I highly doubt it has been substantially revamped since and hence in a slightly decayed state likely won't live up to my initial memory of it. What would it take for it to be substantially revamped retaining the Peres soul but updated to showcase the latest technology most likely with more of a military focus in the aftermath of October 7th? How many years need to pass after October 7th before Israel starts to dream again? Are the international tourists ever coming back in the same numbers as pre the Covid pandemic? The advantage the city and the country has is that will almost certainly outlast today's inhabitants and visitors. Whilst an ageing, angsty human might want to see a return of the days of optimism and a rebuilding of the Third Temple in their lifetime the city and the country might not necessarily need it. The city and the country could write off a decade recovering from the trauma of October 7th and completing strategically important military objectives. The Peres museum revamp could be delayed until the 2030s or even the 2040s. The human not serving in the army can't afford to write off a decade. It is funny how things come full circle. Coming back to Tel Aviv in a cold Patrick Bateman state and now as I mentally prepare to leave for Haifa I feel like a soulful, reminiscing human again.

## 65 A startup nation in a new American century?

Ten years ago I didn't foresee the rise of President Trump. I thought the Republicans were looking for their Barack Obama and Marco Rubio best fitted the mold. I also thought Rubio ran a great campaign under the "New American century" slogan and although it withered under Trump's force of personality and ridicule for drinking too much water (stay hydrated kids) the question Rubio posed will define the 21st century. After a 20th century almost completely orchestrated and dominated by the United States has it peaked or can it reach similar heights or even surpass them in the 21st century? In the 20th century the west coast especially went from uninhabited land, hilltops, military bases and orange groves to Silicon Valley and Hollywood. In technology and the creative arts there was nowhere else you would rather be on the planet and although Israel did better than most at building a technology industry in the shadow of Silicon Valley Israel's successes often got absorbed by the Silicon Valley giants. Today the anti Israel side of the Republican party seems to perceive Israel as a kind of malign parasite that is sucking the life out of its protectorate host whilst the anti Israel side of the Democrat party seems to perceive Israel as a kind of genocidal maniac for completing basic military operations that the United States carried out on multiple occasions in the 20th century and the start of the 21st. I think they are both totally wrong though the former has given me more pause for thought than the latter. The reason I think the US, Israel relationship is not zero sum (gains for one results in losses for the other) is, to yet again quote Peter Thiel, that the US has already gone from zero to one whilst Israel is still in the process of doing so. The problems the US faces, of rejuvenating and revitalizing cities and ecosystems, are orthogonal to the challenges facing Israel which is still largely in its hilltops and military bases phase. Even in a best case scenario of Israel attracting all 7 million Jews from the United States in a population of over 300 million is it really possible that a new American century depends on those 7 million Jews? Also is a child a malign parasite to its parent? Or does the child give the parent the chance to see the early stage of life through adult eyes? In less emotive terms did the United Kingdom and the Anglicized West benefit from the meteoric rise of Silicon Valley and Hollywood or could they have been built to that scale in the United Kingdom assuming the United States had never got off the ground? I don't see any reason why both the United States and Israel can't thrive and flourish in the 21st century though neither is inevitable.

Today President Trump is trying to reverse the obvious decline of Los Angeles and Hollywood amidst riots, looting and aggressive protests against illegal immigrant deportations before Los Angeles hosts the football (soccer) World Cup in 2026 and the Olympics in 2028. Symbolically the first Hollywood star of an Israeli actress, Gal Gadot, regularly gets vandalized just as the Donald Trump Hollywood star regularly got vandalized in the past. Being one star of a multitude of stars, both past and present, on Hollywood Boulevard you could argue that Gadot could have more impact starting a new boulevard of stars in Israel. There was a time when someone thought to install the first star on Hollywood Boulevard just as there was a time when Daeida Wilcox recommended the name "Hollywood" to her husband for land he had purchased (Wikipedia). There was a time when the first "H" of the Hollywood sign (originally Hollywoodland) was erected in the hilltops above the Hollywood district of Los Angeles. Not all are suited to the imagination and sheer grit required to get the wheels in motion to transform a nondescript, uninhabited hilltop into the world's center for movie making and attracting a future Walt Disney, Alfred Hitchcock and Marilyn Monroe. Just as not all are suited to making aliyah to Israel and moving to a nondescript, uninhabited hilltop in Judea or Samaria with limited comforts and surrounded by hostile Arab communities. But some are. Whether Trump succeeds in turning round Los Angeles or not is orthogonal to whether a Jewish Daeida Wilcox on an Israeli hilltop is able to name a new Jewish settlement or not.

## 66 The fog of the Iran war begins

In the middle of the night (approximately 3am Israeli time on June 13th 2025) an earsplitting siren started emanating from my iPhone lying on my bed in an Airbnb in Haifa. I didn't know a smartphone was capable of producing such a deafening noise. I've tried playing music out of the loudspeaker at maximum volume and it wasn't even comparable to the sound of this alert. Has Apple included sound functionality in the iPhone that can only be accessed in emergency scenarios? I assume I'd given an Israeli app like Israel Home Front Command access to this functionality in the pages of terms and conditions that no one ever reads. In a daze and still recovering from the screeching noise I checked news sources and learned that the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) had preemptively attacked Iran and its nuclear sites and that counter strikes on Israel from Iran were a question of when and not if. In recent days the Americans had started evacuating military bases in the region hence it wasn't a surprise to me that it was happening but it seemed earlier than had been choreographed in the media. No doubt the disorientation that I (and no doubt the majority of Israelis) experienced would have been been an asset to the IDF forces and Mossad agents tasked with eliminating the upper echelons of the Iranian high command and Iranian nuclear scientists. I learned the following day that there had been a wave of targeted assassinations that night by Mossad cells already embedded deep within Iran. I also learned that all kinds of ruses had been reported in the media in advance of the strike from Netanyahu vacation plans, Netanyahu son's wedding scheduled for the following week and even a covert Netanyahu visit to the Western Wall disguised as a second visit from the Argentinian President Javier Milei. In normal times you should be distrustful of the mainstream media. In war times the fog of war is suffocating. I say this not to criticize (it has to be this way) but merely to highlight how I and everyone else without classified clearance could read all the publicly available articles and watch all the news coverage they want but in the fog of war you are totally blind. With the details I believe to be true at the time of writing I will outline some thoughts.

The 24 hour news cycle does its best to convince you that every day is unprecedented and historic. The vast majority of the time this isn't the case. Nassim Taleb introduced the aphorism that you should spend a year reading the previous week's newspapers if you have the tendency to think every day's news is truly unprecedented and historic. From whichever angle you approach the start of the Israel Iran war this is a rare example where reading the previous week's newspapers wouldn't feel like a chore or a waste of time. For Israel and Netanyahu in particular this is the big one. It will almost certainly define Netanyahu's legacy after he has spent decades warning of the Iranian nuclear threat including famously holding up a picture of a bomb at the United Nations in 2012 and drawing a red line to demonstrate where he thought Iran's uranium enrichment currently was on the road to a nuclear bomb. At the very least it is comparable to the start of the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 and I suspect it will be perceived in retrospect to be even more pivotal, not only for Israel and the Middle East but also for the superpowers warily sizing each other up over Ukraine and perhaps in later years Taiwan. Assuming it goes well President Trump and the Americans will want to be associated with the success and the start of a new Middle East epoch without the risk of a Iranian nuclear bomb hanging over it. Assuming it goes badly President Trump and the Americans will want to hang the failure on Netanyahu for prematurely moving to military force and as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated taking "unilateral action". Hence for Israel and Netanyahu the stakes could not be higher. The Americans, publicly at least, began by hedging their bets or in the parent-child analogy seeing how far the child could run before firmer parental intervention was required. As the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine drag on with no obvious end in sight there is a potential path for a (relatively) quick victory here where Israel, the United States and American allies in the Middle East region emerge with all military objectives met and bask in the glow of a decisive military victory and the start of a new epoch in the Middle East. Iraq did not offer such a path, Ukraine certainly didn't and you would expect any hostilities over Taiwan to also be a drawn out cat and mouse game as superpowers size each other up over a small island rather than a Ukrainian sized land mass. This could be a rare example where all interests (other than obviously Khamenei's regime in Iran) converge. Although Israel is an American ally it hasn't been or isn't, under Netanyahu at least, outwardly adversarial to China or Russia. Walking through Jerusalem train station or using the Tel Aviv light rail you see Chinese lettering on escalators and trains purchased from Chinese companies. To China Israel is not Taiwan. To Russia Israel is not Ukraine. If there is one conflict where there is hope that China or Russia don't try to inflame the conflict to undermine the Americans it would be this one.

On the offensive front after barely 3 days of war Israel seems to be exceeding expectations. As I write this the IDF has claimed full aerial superiority over the Iranian capital Tehran and destroyed a third of Iran's ballistic missile launchers (Times of Israel). This follows up that first night of assassinations of the Iranian high command (excluding the Supreme Leader Khamenei) under that initial cloak of darkness. It is unclear exactly how much damage Israel can do to the Iranian nuclear sites, especially the more fortified underground ones, without American stealth bombers and bunker busting bombs or alternatively troops on the ground. Once Israel exhausts its current capabilities from the air (likely still weeks away) there could be a choice between greater American involvement to complete the job from the air or Israeli troops entering a teetering Iran by foot. The optics could not be more drastically different as a bellwether for the future of the Middle East. On the offensive front some form of Israeli victory seems inevitable, it is just a question of how far the Iranian nuclear program can be set back, whether a regime change is sparked by the military action and to what extent Israel and/or the the United States are associated and claim credit for that victory. On the defensive front it is more mixed. It is jarring to see places in Tel Aviv I visited or walked past just days ago with windows smashed from Iranian missiles. Entire buildings have been destroyed and the death toll as I write this is 14. Previous Iranian ballistic missile attacks in 2024 (April and October) had significantly fewer casualties and significantly less building damage. The sirens directing citizens to bomb shelters has been averaging three times per night. One would hope that the IDF's aerial superiority inflicting damage on Iran's missile launchers would result in a decline in daily Israeli casualties, building damage and siren regularity over time. Israel's missile defense systems including the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow and the American Thaad are not impenetrable and 30 out of 370 ballistic missiles fired at Israel in recent days have made an impact (Wall Street Journal). To what extent these systems can be sustained in the case of weeks or months of such high frequency barrages does not (understandably) seem to be public knowledge. In the absence of a highly unlikely disaster scenario where superpowers turn it into a proxy war you would expect this to be the final unloading of a dying Iranian regime. The decades long term planning, the execution and the competence displayed thus far by Israel (and the United States to the extent it wants to claim credit) is staggering.

Assuming there isn't a full Iranian surrender and an agreement to decommision all Iranian nuclear sites I expect President Trump and the Americans will choose to step in and complete whatever tasks are unable to be completed by the Israelis. This window of opportunity only presents itself once in decades and if the Americans are robustly aligned with the Israelis (and multiple Arab states) that Iran musn't have nuclear weapons (which they appear to be) to let this window pass and not finish the job would be surprising to say the least. It wouldn't be disastrous for the Israelis if the Americans chose to leave them to it. It is possible the Israelis could complete the job without American involvement though it would obviously be much tougher. However, if the Iranian nuclear program was still active at the culmination of the war it would be an opportunity, planned for over multiple decades, missed. There are murmurings from some of the isolationist or anti Israel wing of the Republican party in the United States that this wouldn't align with Trump's America First policy agenda. Even if you could magic away the invention and existence of nuclear weapons (which forces superpowers to have a global perspective) it is bizarre to argue that the world's pre-eminent superpower, or even one of multiple superpowers, doesn't have interests in a region. It is merely a month since Trump toured the Middle East agreeing over 2 trillion USD in trade deals (whitehouse.gov). Would it be America First to not make those trade deals? Would it be America First to allow a competing superpower to make those trade deals instead? Would it be America First to leave a superpower vacuum in the Middle East for a competing superpower vacuum to fill? In a world of nuclear weapons would it be America First to not care which nation states can fire nuclear weapons at American allies or worse at America itself? The argument is preposterous. The United States could choose to not be a superpower and abdicate superpower interests and responsibilities to other superpowers like China and Russia. It could choose to leave oversight of the world's nuclear artillery to the Chinese and the Russians. But whether that choice would be America First is at the very least questionable. What I understood when Trump stood on a platform of America First was that American interests would be put first and maybe more subtly that America would remain the world's pre-eminent superpower during his Presidency. I don't think it ever meant abdicating being a 21st century superpower entirely.

"What we're seeing from President Trump is a generational shift in policy... Over time, we were told the world would converge toward a uniform set of bland, secular, universal ideals, regardless of culture or country. And those that didn't want to converge, well, our policymakers would make it their goal to force them by any means necessary.... How hard could it be to build a few democracies in the Middle East? Well, almost impossibly hard, it turns out, and unbelievably costly. And it wasn't our politicians who bore the consequences of such a profound miscalculation. It was the American people to the tune of trillions of dollars; but more than anyone, it was born by the people who were in your shoes just a few short years ago - by our service members and their families." US Vice President JD Vance at the US Naval Academy (May 2025)

It may still be premature to do so (especially as Trump and the Americans weigh up active involvement in Iranian strikes) but with a first night of uninterrupted sleep in 5 days, zero overnight sirens and the Israeli Home Front Command app no longer issuing advance warning alerts to stay near bomb shelters it is natural to start zooming out from immediate concerns and instead start thinking about the day after, the historical context of this war and why this Iran war seems (again may still be premature) to be in stark contrast to the loss of life, the trillions of dollars spent and the damage to the American reputation and trust in its institutions post the Iraq war in 2003. In the United Kingdom the previously popular Blair government never recovered from its involvement in the Iraq war, the claim that Iraq could launch "weapons of mass destruction" within 45 minutes (as Parliament discussed this claim for well over 45 minutes) and the death in suspicious circumstances of a British weapons expert, David Kelly, who disputed the government's claims. Even over 20 years on it is only human to fall victim to the narrative fallacy and assume this Iran war will follow the same pattern. A Middle Eastern Muslim country beginning with "I" under a dictatorial regime, uncertainty over its exact nuclear capabilities and what appears to be a likely regime change on the horizon. However, that is where the similarities end. I personally believe, and all the evidence thus far points towards this, that this Iranian war will end up being perceived as an unparalleled success and rather than permanently wounding the reputations of those involved, it will significantly enhance them perhaps even permanently. First of all let's start with the American commander-in-chief. Regardless of whether President Trump chooses to actively participate in Iranian strikes or not, as I write this President Trump has stated on Truth Social that he knows exactly where Iran's Saddam Hussein is hiding, his inner circle and senior military command has been killed and not a single American troop or American fighter jet has yet been put in harm's way. Compare this to the carnage, American loss of life and American taxpayer money spent in the 9 months it took to capture Saddam Hussein from the commencement of the Iraq war. If nothing else Trump has displayed that he values American soldiers' lives more than anything else and will do everything in his power to complete military objectives without risking American lives. On the "weapons of mass destruction" any active American involvement would likely be restricted to Iran's known nuclear facilities including the one at Fordo buried deep inside a mountain. In March 2023 the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that uranium had been enriched to 83.7 percent at Fordo with 90 percent enrichment needed for nuclear weapons (New York Times). The Iraq days of dodgy (intelligence) dossiers, new marketing terms bandied around such as "weapons of mass destruction" with unclear definitions and UN weapons inspectors unable to determine if Iraq had any nuclear program whatsoever are replaced by discussions over uranium enrichment percentage points. Finally, the stated foreign policy objective of installing a Western democratic system on a Middle Eastern country has given way to a Trump foreign policy doctrine (as described by US Vice President JD Vance) which is indifferent to what replaces Supreme Leader Khamenei's regime (assuming it falls) as long as the nuclear program is decommissioned and Iran doesn't pose an existential threat to the United States or its allies. On the face of it the Iran war is replaying the mistakes of the Iraq one. But delve a little deeper into the detail and the differences couldn't be any more stark. The Iran war is shaping up to be the first major triumph of Trump's foreign policy doctrine and for now at least that is being drowned out by squabbles over whether acting like a superpower is America First.

"A day after the US elections (2016) I phoned Donald Trump to congratulate him on his victory. "Hey Bibi" he said. "Why don't you come over to see me next week?"... Most of our first meeting focused on Iran. The President repeated his intention to leave the Iran nuclear deal and then suddenly popped the question "Why didn't you bomb them?" he asked about Iran's nuclear facilities. "Because I didn't have the votes at the time" I answered frankly, "But it is still an option as are other things". This was accurate. In the intervening years and as my authority grew I had authorized increasingly daring Mossad operations against Iran's nuclear program. I also ramped up Israel's military capacities to strike Iran's nuclear facilities. By the time I met Trump in the White House I was confident that I would have both the means and the votes to carry out what was necessary to impede Iran's nuclear aspirations." Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi, My Story 2022)

When it comes to the Israeli commander-in-chief I'm not entirely sure where to start. First off I have to be perfectly honest and admit I had doubts over the previous couple of years. I have written extensively about Netanyahu earlier and I've certainly never been in the anti-Bibi camp. The achievements in his political career pre October 7th and pre his autobiography published in 2022 speak for themselves. Since October 7th though there were a lot of questions. Firstly, to what extent was he and his administration culpable for the October 7th attacks where Hamas terrorists were able to infiltrate Israeli communities using relatively primitive methods to breakout from Gaza? Secondly, why had the Gaza military campaign dragged on for such a long time, why had it taken so long to rescue the majority of the hostages, why were Israeli soldiers securing Gaza territory only to leave and return months later to resecure the same territory? Thirdly, it is widely appreciated that over time "power corrupts" and Netanyahu was now comfortably Israel's longest serving Prime Minister. Was this the same Netanyahu from 10 or 20 years ago or was he just clinging to power without the early zeal to pursue Israeli interests and longer term goals? Fourthly, the Iranian nuclear threat was always going to be inextricably tied to Netanyahu's legacy. Was he just delaying dealing with it because it suited his political survival to always have this future goal to point to to justify not removing him from power? Fifthly, and perhaps most critically of all, had his relationship with President Trump soured? Was Netanyahu no longer the effective bridge to the United States he had been his whole career? At Trump's lowest point disputing the validity of the 2020 US elections and being accused of a Capitol insurrection on January 6th 2021 had Netanyahu abandoned him in an attempt to ingratiate himself with the new Biden administration? Even the most legendary global leaders of all time had expiry dates. Had Netanyahu passed his? I still think a number of these unanswered questions remain valid. But the way this Iran war is currently shaping up with not only the future of Israel and the Middle East in its crosshairs but Trump's foreign policy legacy and maybe even the United States' authority as the 21st century's pre-eminent global superpower would you really want anyone else to be Israeli Prime Minster at this time? Netanyahu's autobiography published in 2022 was 553 pages. And yet here we are in the middle of June 2025 and I don't think it is an exaggeration to say his life's work really does all come down to this. Does Trump put his chips on Bibi and Israel and a new epoch for Israel and American allies in the Middle East? Or does he back away from the table and continue to support Israel from the sidelines? Is this a new Franklin D Roosevelt and Churchill partnership for the 21st century? 

## 67 The smoke begins to clear

It was left to Roosevelt's sucessor, Harry Truman, to authorize the first and thus far only use of nuclear weapons in war against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When the mushroom clouds dissipated and the damage could be surveyed tens of thousands of civilians were found dead and tens of thousands more died in the following months from burns, radiation sickness and other injuries. It forced Japan into an abrupt surrender in World War 2 but that authorization changed the world forever. From that point on the primary responsibility of a nation's leader above all else was to ensure their major cities didn't suffer the same fate as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Everything else from economic policy to education to law and order fade into insignificance under a credible threat of another use of a nuclear weapon. When Trump authorized a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities in the early hours of June 22nd 2025 Israeli/Iranian time he wasn't authorizing the first usage of nuclear weapons since World War 2 but it was the first usage of the most powerful non-nuclear bombs the United States (publicly) owns and the first attempt to destroy militarily a hostile adversary's nuclear artillery. The ripples from Hiroshima and Nagasaki will propagate through human history until the end of humanity so one hopes Trump's authorization doesn't prove as significant as Truman's. It is undoubtedly a major call though not only for Israel, the likely intended destination of an Iranian nuclear missile, but for the United States, other superpowers, other nuclear powers, aspiring nuclear powers and anyone within range of a nuclear weapon. Other than perhaps space stations, the Moon and Mars that is everyone who resides on planet earth. Thankfully the United States demonstrated similar levels of competence to the Israelis, who had cleared a safe path through Iranian skies for American stealth bombers, but with greater military power at their disposal. Trump's final two week ultimatum to the Iranian regime, movements of Americans bombers away from the Middle East towards Guam as a decoy and maybe even late stage Iranian negotiations with sidelined Europeans seemed to all be taken from a similar playbook to the fictional Netanyahu vacation plans to maintain the element of surprise. That Trump announced the mission had been completed and the US Air Force had left Iranian airspace on his social media platform Truth Social before the world's media even knew it had begun took cloak and dagger intrigue to new heights. Throw a nuclear weapon dimension into the already inevitable fog of war and you have to lay on the fog extra thick.

Some things are now much clearer than they were weeks or months ago. All the speculated friction and mistrust between Trump and Netanyahu, to the extent that there was any truth to it in the first place (longer term red herring?) has been blown away. Trump and Netanyahu, and the American and Israeli adminstrations they head up, are totally aligned. Barring something fanciful like the Israelis using a nuclear weapon without pre-warning the Americans this is effectively now a joint operation. The Israelis will continue to complete the vast majority of the day-to-day operations but if there is further escalation from the Iranians or further nuclear sites need to be dealt with or revisted the Americans have now set the precedent that they are willing to step in if needed. In addition, after being ridiculed (perhaps unfairly) by Wall Street traders with their TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) trade after repeated Trump climbdowns on particularly severe trade tariffs Trump has shown that he is capable and willing to make the boldest and toughest of decisions. It doesn't get much higher stakes than authorizing the destruction of an adversary's nuclear sites. Competing superpowers such as China and Russia, to the extent that they weren't also caught flatfooted like the world's media, have broadly stayed out of it. Vladimir Putin offered to mediate between Israel and Iran and highlighted the 2 million Russians living in Israel making Israel "almost a Russian speaking country today" (St Petersburg International Economic Forum). There were reports of China sending mystery cargo planes into Iran a day after Israel's first attacks (Daily Telegraph) which would have sparked some alarm that China was seeking to turn it into a superpower proxy war. Thankfully that doesn't seem to have been repeated or massively ramped up in the subsequent days. I speculated earlier that to Russia Israel wasn't Ukraine and to China Israel wasn't Taiwan and this seems to have played out but it wasn't a certainty prior to Israel's first attacks. The Arab states, from the American allies to the Iran sympathizers, just like the Europeans have broadly stayed out of it. Assuming the Israelis and Americans complete the job in Iran there will be a couple of Arab states looking nervously at the defanging and/or non-existence of a rabidly anti Israel and anti American player in the Middle East and desperately wanting to avoid being perceived as the next Iran. This could very easily jolt an extension of the Abraham Accords into overdrive as Arab states edge away from being Iran adjacent politically and into the orbit of the Americans and Israelis. The smoke is only starting to clear though. George W Bush gave that infamous speech on an aircraft carrier in front of a Mission Accomplished banner six weeks after the start of the Iraq war (Wikipedia). Ten days after the start of the Iran war and just over a day after the first American strikes I suspect you won't see Trump or Netanyahu doing the same for a while longer yet.

## 68 Mission accomplished?

On June 23rd 2025 we saw the Iranian response to American strikes and a declaration from President Trump on Truth Social (how is Truth Social's stock price doing by the way?!) that all parties had agreed to a ceasefire in a war that would henceforth be known as the Twelve Day War, inspired by the Six Day War of 1967. That naming lasted barely a couple of hours when Iran broke the ceasefire with multiple missile barrages at civilian areas including killing four and injuring at least 22 in Be'er Sheva. Although it was announced with the best of intentions, for multiple reasons Trump clearly doesn't want to embroil the United States in another Middle Eastern war, this was effectively Trump's Mission Accomplished moment. However, there may be some subtleties that are worth exploring. First off, the Iranian response to American strikes on its nuclear facilities. The headline item was Iran launches missile strikes against a US military base in Qatar. In reality though Iran prewarned both the Americans and the Qataris it was coming and all missiles were shot down without killing or even slightly injuring an American or Qatari. This emphasized a number of things. Firstly, the Iranians are desperate for the Americans not to participate further in this war to the extent that they will engage in military theater to save face. Secondly, to the Iranians, Americans and Qataris Israeli civilian lives are fair game but American and Qatari lives are not. If an American or Qatari had died from an Iranian missile, despite the Iranians doing everything they could to avoid it, the American response would have been severe. Thirdly, and this ties into the Mission Accomplished ceasefire announcement, this was the moment the Americans attempted to extricate themselves from the conflict as if the bombing of the Iranian nuclear sites had never happened. I speculated in the previous paragraph that the Americans and Israelis after the bombing of the nuclear sites were totally aligned and this was effectively now a joint operation. This seems to have been premature. The American mission, to use American stealth bombers and bunker busting bombs to neutralize Iranian nuclear sites may very well have been accomplished. I find it fanciful now though that the Israelis will settle for any military objective(s) other than totally wiping out Iran's ability to fire missiles at Israel (at the time of writing over half of Iran's missile launchers have been destroyed and Israel continues to control Iranian skies) and sparking a regime change after decades of terrorism, chaos and death funded and supported by the Iranian regime. Mission accomplished for the Americans, perhaps. Mission incomplete for the Israelis, almost certainly.

"We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f\*\*\* they're doing." President Trump

In the fog of war it is impossible to know what is authentic and what is misdirection. After what was pulled off prior to the first Israeli strikes and the American strikes anything is possible. On the face of it Trump is angry with the Israelis and there is a split between the Americans and the Israelis over whether it is mission accomplished or not. But if the Americans wanted to extricate themselves from the war and position themselves once more as a quasi neutral mediator this is exactly the sort of message they would be sending publicly. Regardless of whether the anger is authentic or yet another ruse nothing will take away from what Trump and the Americans have achieved in recent days. It is truly historic. From my perspective both the Americans and the Israelis are doing exactly what they should be doing assuming their objectives aren't in perfect alignment. The Israelis want to put a stop to Iranian missiles once and for all. After all the Israeli casualties over the years you can hardly blame them. Any end state that results in more Iranian missiles fired at Israeli civilians in the coming months or years, via Iranian skies that today are controlled by the Israelis, is unacceptable to them. The Americans are prioritizing preventing the war from spiralling and minimizing the chances of it needing further American intervention. Assuming Trump's anger is authentic one hopes the Americans and Israelis can smooth over their differences and see the other side's perspective. Assuming Trump's anger is yet another example of misdirection I've been fooled yet again. It certainly isn't the first time in this war and it won't be the last.

## 69 Threading the needle on a Middle Eastern peace deal

On June 27nd 2025 the ceasefire brokered, announced and defended verbally in the sternest of terms by President Trump has held for two days after what appeared to be initial breaches. Each day that passes cements the American extrication from involvement in direct hostilities which seems to have been the primary American objective post the bombing of the Iranian nuclear sites. It is speculated that Netanyahu and Trump are working on a plan to end the war in Gaza and expand the Abraham Accords (Times of Israel). Satisfying Israeli objectives is going to be much more complex and multi-layered than satisfying the American objective. I discussed earlier the Israeli tendency to follow up emphatic military victories with weak political surrenders including after the Six Day War in 1967. In that case the political surrender and the status quo implemented on the Temple Mount ended up lasting for decades. If this indeed was a Twelve Day War approximately 50 years after the Six Day War what is needed to prevent the need for a Eighteen Day War in another 50 years? And many more wars and Israeli civilian and soldier deaths in the intervening period? What are the expectations of a serious nation state like say the United States with centuries of history? A serious nation state knows its borders and exerts sovereignty within those borders. It doesn't have to go to global organizations like the United Nations and justify why it doesn't form new nation states within those borders especially when it only controls a land mass similar in size to New Jersey. It doesn't let foreign nations and foreign religions dictate how the center of its capital/Capitol is governed. If a foreign nation fires a missile into its borders it immediately declares war on that foreign nation and has allies that will support it verbally and/or militarily to ensure no further missiles are fired at it. It doesn't shrug its shoulders and wait another 50 years to prevent it happening again. Is this the moment Israel becomes a serious nation state like say the United States, obviously without the global authority and military might of a (pre-eminent) superpower, or is this yet another stepping stone and opportunity missed to become a serious nation state? Is this the moment killing an Israeli civilian or soldier becomes as consequential as killing an American or Qatari? Or will Israelis continue to be cannon fodder for another 50 years as the price they have to pay for living in the Middle East? It isn't impossible that Trump may still thread the needle on a lasting Middle Eastern peace deal. But whether Israel and Netanyahu make political surrenders (yet again) is a different question entirely.

One of the technological miracles post internet is that with the permission of the participants (or perhaps without if you're the CIA or Mossad) you can hear conversations that you would never have been able to hear pre internet. In some cases you can hear those conversations live as they happen. Pre internet you would have needed to have obtained the permission of a radio station or TV channel to beam a conversation to a larger audience. Post internet generally (there are counterexamples with banning, shadowbanning and suppressing freedom of reach of course) conversations can be beamed to a larger audience without needing the permission of a particular radio station or TV channel. Living in this post internet era I have been able to listen in on conversations I would have never been able to listen in on in a pre internet era. One particular conversation I have been listening to intently over the past year or so is the conversation between former American spy Jonathan Pollard and Rabbi David Bar-Hayim on the Machon Shilo YouTube channel or when YouTube is being particularly censorship trigger happy the much less censorship trigger happy Rumble channel. Jonathan Pollard served 30 years in a US prison for violating the Espionage Act and handing over classified US intelligence to the Israelis. Bar-Hayim has spent 20 years building the Shilo Institute for the "research, elucidation and dissemination of the Torah of Israel" (Wikipedia). In the worlds of intelligence services and rabbinic Judaism, of which until more recently I knew very little, it has given me an insight into what these communities might be thinking on various topics that wouldn't typically get covered on the mainstream media. One of the topics they've covered extensively is their frustrations that they've held for many years with both Netanyahu and the Israeli "juristocracy" for keeping Israel's democratic system in a metaphorical straitjacket guaranteeing terrible outcomes for the Israeli electorate. In a recent conversation they discussed Netanyahu's embrace of Judaism and G\*d rather late in life and whether it is authentic or merely politically convenient. There is an interesting parallel with President Trump's recent embrace of Christianity and G\*d rather late in life post an assassination attempt at a political rally in Pennsylvania in which a bullet grazed his ear. I described Trump's earlier decision on whether to bomb Iranian nuclear sites as a choice of whether to put his chips on Bibi and Israel. In setting out his position on what is acceptable for Israel in upcoming negotiations we'll see if Bibi is willing to put his chips on Judaism and G\*d. What does G\*d want for Israel in the next 50 years and beyond? Does G\*d want 50 more years of uncertainty, chaos and suffering because sovereignty over Jewish lands and its holiest sites was left ambiguous or worse given away? Another 50 years of Arabs killing Jews and Jews killing Arabs because Jews can't decide whether they deserve full sovereignty over a relatively small strip of land in the Middle East? Or does the Torah outline a different path?

"Paradoxically the only way G\*d can be revealed is by being concealed. By obscuring the divine light creation allows it to shine... It is the human task through the performance of the commandments and enactment of the divine will to reveal G\*d's presence in the world." Ezra Glinter (biography of Menachem Mendel Schneerson,"The Rebbe")

If Itamar Ben-Gvir wasn't waiting in the wings one would be more anxious about the prospect of Netanyahu caving under American pressure to set Israel on a path to repeat the mistakes of the last 50 years. Just like in Michelangelo's famous "The Creation of Adam" painting G\*d's finger may be outstretched but it requires Adam to unbend and also outstretch his finger to meet G\*d halfway. Ultimately after a 553 page story which no doubt hasn't been pleasant at various points wrestling with everyone from the Israeli juristocracy to multiple American administrations, fixed for whatever reason on Israel being permanently locked in a battle with a non-existent Palestinian state, it would be nice to see Netanyahu be the one to deliver a platform for Israel's future security as a nation state with actualized borders. But if he can't deliver it having Ben-Gvir waiting in the wings as a potential successor, someone who for 30 years has been steadfastly against carving up Jewish lands in a misguided attempt to achieve peace, has taken a much deeper interest in the management of Judaism's holiest site and arguably wears his religion and belief in G\*d with greater ease, offers some significant insurance. Just like President Trump in the United States, Netanyahu's national poll numbers have been repeatedly underestimated and one would assume the same effect applies to other political figures on the right wing such as Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. For most of Netanyahu's career he has led coalitions where he was positioned as the most right wing of that coalition but today that is no longer the case. This could get Netanyahu over the finish line for his political legacy with a combination of Netanyahu being less politically exposed and the futility of American pressure to push him out only resulting in an even more right wing coalition. But if it doesn't get him over the finish line there are alternative paths for the divine light to shine through that are already detectable to the human eye.

## 70 Revisiting the intersection or barrier between Judaism and Christianity

"There's an important distinction between the new covenant and the old. There is a new covenant that G\*d made with the Christians and that does supersede the old covenant. But the New Testament doesn't supersede the Old. Because quite frankly if it really did we wouldn't have an Old Testament in the bible. A phrase I learned in Christian philosophy many years ago is that the New Testament is in the Old concealed and the Old Testament is in the New revealed. You see here the intimate relationship between the Old and the New Testament." Dinesh D'Souza (Alex Jones debate with Nick Fuentes)

I stated earlier that the intersection or barrier between Judaism and Christianity is a challenging one. It is not as challenging as the one between Christianity and Islam but it is challenging nonetheless. In Matthew 5:17 Jesus stated "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them." Hence it is difficult to justify the supersessionist Christian belief that the new covenant replaced the old, that the Holy Land lost its holiness overnight, that the Jews should abandon their customs, traditions and 613 commandments or that the Jews shouldn't pine for a rebuilding of their Holy Temple and instead discard the perceived "baggage" of Judaism and convert to Christianity. Unsurprisingly I subscribe to the dispensationalist belief that different peoples have different roles and narrative arcs and it is absurd to think all Jews should convert to Christianity or all Christians should convert to Judaism, especially under the threat of force. Judaism doesn't proselytize whilst Christianity does but that doesn't mean Jews can't respect Christians and vice versa. A Christian proselytizing to a devout Orthodox or Hasidic Jew living an authentic Jewish life in Jerusalem is not the same as that Christian proselytizing to a sinning, despairing atheist in say London. The former already has a deep spiritual life and a connection to G\*d whilst the latter does not. The Christian Church may be the "new Israel" for the Christians but Israel has always just been Israel for the Jews. That's not to say that Christian sites and churches should be demolished within Israel because the Christians have founded their "new Israel" outside of Israel. As stated before it is difficult to see how the modern day nation state of Israel would have come into being without the cooperation of Christians and Jews benefit not only from Christian tourism but also the interest and support evangelical Christians show for Israel from abroad. Similarly, sustaining and visiting the historical Christian sites such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem where Christians believe Jesus was resurrected breathes life into the Christian faith. The human experience is deeply impacted by experiencing places in the flesh and being able to trace the footsteps of historic and religious figures. No technology from the world's most impressive churches and cathedrals to virtual reality handsets will ever be able to fully replicate that experience. Every day and every generation that passes without the rebuilding of the Holy Temple is another day and another generation that doesn't get to experience the Holy Temple in Jerusalem like Jesus did.

There is some natural mistrust between Jews and Christians dating back to the millennia when the Jews suffered in exile and were scattered "among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other" (Deuteronomy 28:64). Having lost their lands and being at the mercy of their patrons in foreign lands gave added credence to the notion that G\*d had deserted Jews and they were being punished for not accepting the new covenant and refusing to follow what was essentially a new religion. Even today accusations of rejecting Jesus abound from the supersessionists when it is not clear what "accept" and "reject" mean in this context. If "accept" means identifying Jesus as the Jewish Messiah (Moshiach) and appending the New Testament books to the Torah and Tanakh as Jewish holy books then accepting and not rejecting Jesus essentially means converting to Christianity and ditching Judaism. If "accept" means identifying that a Jew called Jesus existed and bore a new religion that the vast majority of Jews don't follow as their religious practices existed prior to Jesus then I suspect large swathes of Jews do "accept" Jesus. Regardless being taken from the nations and being brought back into their own land and the land of their ancestors (Ezekiel 36:24, Ezekiel 37:21, Jeremiah 16:15 etc) presents a significant challenge to the supersessionists and perhaps partly explains the bile and hysteria that is directed towards the modern day nation state of Israel. A rather bizarre alliance of supersessionist Christians, Muslim extremists and atheists with completely disparate belief systems share next to nothing in common apart from a shared interest in not wanting to see the restoration of the "fortunes of my people Israel and Judah" (Jeremiah 30:3). However, the modern day nation state of Israel merely existing if not thriving significantly strengthens the hand of the non-supersessionist Christians and presents an opportunity for Jews and Christians to turn the page on a volatile and oftentimes ugly chapter of co-existence. Now the asymmetry of Christians having their own lands and Jews not has been corrected and biblical prophecy seems to be being fulfilled one would hope the next millennia of relations would be less fraught.

## 71 Oil and water: Why Islamic and Judeo-Christian civilizations do not mix

The United States showed in the 20th century that a Judeo-Christian civilization could not only function but thrive and dominate. Although there will always be theological disagreements between Jews and Christians on the divinity of the New Testament books and whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah or not that didn't prevent the United States from becoming the pre-eminent superpower, the most formidable military power, the most innovative technological power and the most admired cultural force. As a minority American Jews outperformed relative to their small number (approximately 5 million in 1950 rising to approximately 6 million in 1990) in various fields from finance, law, medicine to the creative arts but to the extent that Judaism clashed with Christianity, rather than merely sprouting it, Jews did not try to impose Judaism on Christian societies and accepted that as a small minority in exile they flourished only under the patronage and consent of the Christian majority. They certainly did not convert Christian churches into Jewish synagogues or worse bulldoze them to build synagogues on top of them, they did not have billions of Jews waiting in the wings to migrate into the United States and fundamentally change the civilization that had been built there, they did not carry out a multitude of terrorist attacks culminating in the Twin Towers attack on 9/11 and they (generally) didn't ally with socialist and communist movements to overturn the capitalistic nature of the United States' economy. To be short American Jews were broadly happy to operate, compete and contribute within the American system rather than attempting to overturn or destroy it. Although no (minority) population is perfect the United States may look back on its Jewish minority population in the 20th century as the gold standard for how a minority population can and should operate as other minority populations swell in number in the 21st century to far beyond the size of the Jewish minority in the 20th century. That's when we're really start to see why, despite their differences, Judeo-Christian civilizations function and don't try to destroy the other in a way that other paired civilizations do not.

"The new rulers of Cambodia call 1975 Year Zero, the dawn of an age in which there will be no families, no sentiment, no expressions of love or grief, no medicines, no hospitals, no schools, no books, no learning, no holidays, no music, no song, no post, no money - only work and death." John Pilger (Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia)

What Rabbi Meir Kahane recognized and what he was legally crucified for and ultimately murdered for is that when violence asymmetries exist and one party holds itself to higher ethical standards than another party the more violent party can hold the less violent party's interests hostage and permanently ignored. If one party is willing to use tools such as hostage taking, blowing up civilian buses, concreting over the other party's holiest sites, threatening excavators of historical sites and ultimately using nuclear weapons to destroy a civilization that party can continue the delusion that the other's civilization is stunted and lacking legitimacy. Having Jews worship a golden Islamic shrine at their holiest site is the ultimate humiliation ritual. But it persists because of the violence asymmetry. If there was no asymmetry Jews would demand the same rights to control Islam's holiest site at Mecca as Muslims have at Judaism's holiest site at the Temple Mount and threaten to blow up worshippers at Mecca if those rights were withdrawn. Judeo-Christian ethics (rightly in my opinion) prevent Jews from threatening to blow up innocent civilian worshippers. But Islamic ethics seem not to. There is no respect for the rights of non Islamic civilizations and the history of those civilizations which generally outdate the Islamic civilizations. Like the actual genocidal dictators such as Hitler and Pol Pot, rather than those falsely accused of genocide in recent times, there seems to be a desire to restart from Year Zero and destroy what came before. Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge attempted to erase Cambodian history, remove all vestiges of the past including the "corruption" of Western capitalist ideas and start afresh. The result from an actual genocide rather than a fake one was up to 2 million killed. Whilst Jews and Christians (again rightly in my opinion) preserve Islamic history including at the National Library of Israel which I recently visited, Muslims show a desire to erase and destroy Jewish and Christian history to make Islam Year Zero. These asymmetries make a paired civilization with Islam impossible.

"How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.... The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - either as a child, a wife, a concubine - must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.... No stronger retrograde force exists in the world.... were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome." Sir Winston Churchill (The River War)

Israel has been hardened in the past century against the notion that a Judeo-Islamic civilization can function and results in anything other the death, suffering and the attempted destruction of the Jewish population. Some, like Rabbi Meir Kahane and Itamar Ben-Gvir, knew all along. Others needed the terrorist attacks of October 7th 2023 before they were able to come to this realization despite many living through the Second Intifada and civilian buses being blown up on an almost weekly basis. Rewarding this terrorism with land is almost as absurd as Jews worshipping a golden Islamic shrine at their holiest site. But even today Jews protest to reward the October 7th hostage takers with favorable negotiation terms so the hostage takers can regroup, rearm and repeat. A significant minority of the native population will, no matter what happens and how dreadful the circumstances, remain so absurdly stupid and shortsighted that nation states can't afford to pair them with a significant Muslim minority to take advantage of them. The native population, however stupid, can't be removed but the size of the Muslim minority can be managed downwards. Unfortunately the rest of the West has not been hardened like Israel has. It is on a trajectory to learn in the most painful fashion imaginable that a Christian-Islamic civilization will not turn out any better than an attempted Judeo-Islamic one. Although the predominantly Pakistani grooming gangs in the UK might seem like a nadir (what can be worse than your kids being sexually abused whilst the police force and state protects the perpetuators?) this is only the start without the mother of all 180 degree u-turns. And whilst all organs of the state and the King of England welcome Islam in as the new national religion and imprison those who protest it there is no peaceful path to course correct.

## 72 When all roads lead to Baruch Goldstein portraits on the wall

In 1994 Baruch Goldstein entered a mosque in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and opened fire killing 29 and wounding 125 Muslim worshippers. It was an extremely rare example of a Jewish terrorist attack and Jews no longer standing for the blatant violence asymmetry amongst wave after wave of Islamic terrorism. Until recently Ben-Gvir hung a portrait of Goldstein at his home as a symbol that when pushed to extremes Jews were also capable of carrying out the same evil acts that Arabs were capable of. The entire purpose of democratic systems, other than as a mechanism for the peaceful transfer of power, is to provide the electorate with the ability to vote for legislative agendas that resolve the problems and the challenges they are facing. During the First and Second Intifadas there was nothing more pressing than putting a stop to Jewish civilians being repeatedly blown up in suicide bombings. The Israeli democratic system was unable to do that and all it could come up with is to offer the terrorists land in exchange for peace and banning those like Rabbi Meir Kahane who suggested that Arab deportations were the only answer. I personally do not condone Goldstein's actions. However, good people being forced to do evil things to match the evil that evil people are capable of is a story as old as time. Do I condone the dropping of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Do I condone the carpet bombing of Dresden by Allied forces in 1945? When all else fails, war is the only option and only one side can win absolutely nothing can be off the table. Once you've got to that point all systems have failed. It is the responsibility of those with power and influence within those systems to offer release valves and paths to course correct so that future Baruch Goldsteins don't think the only option left available to them is resorting to the same evil that is being perpetuated on their people. In a way I'm disappointed Ben-Gvir took the portrait down. As Minister of National Security he now has the ability within the democratic system to deliver on ensuring intifadas and October 7ths never happen to the Jewish people within Israel again. If he fails to do that I can't think of a better cautionary tale than the eyes of Baruch Goldstein looking down on him at the breakfast table.

It is July 27th 2025 and coming up to two years since the October 7th terrorist attacks and all sides seem to be conspiring to ensure the worst case scenario occurs in Gaza. An endless war where young Israeli soldiers continue to die for seemingly no reason with unclear military objectives, a global propaganda war that Israel is losing as Gazans struggle to gain access to food and medical supplies, Israeli hostages that remain in captivity with no timetable on attempting to free them by force and ending a near two year negotiation process with terrorists; in short it is a total mess and the speculative excuses for a seeming total lack of leadership are running extremely bare. During the era of US Presidents pushing foolhardy, idiotic and unrealistic two state solutions Netanyahu's prevarication and evasion was a major asset. Today with a sympathetic US President his inability to lay out a clear strategy for ending the war in Gaza is killing Israeli soldiers, starving Gazans and driving Israel's global reputation into the mud. For every Israeli soldier that dies in Gaza that soldier's family should ask what they died for and hold Netanyahu responsible. It is becoming absolutely pathetic. How long is Israel going to negotiate with terrorists? It is already coming up to 2 years. Another year? Another 5 years? Another 10? What is going to happen to the approximately 2 million Gaza inhabitants? Is Gaza going to be rebuilt with those 2 million still there reverting back to the situation on October 6th? Are they going to be killed by bombings or mass starvation? Or are those who don't want to fight a war going to be moved to an alternative territory in the Arab world or in Africa? Netanyahu repeatedly goes to the White House bearing souvenirs and Nobel Peace Prize nominations like a souvenir salesman whilst Israelis and Gazans die due to his inability to formulate a strategy for ending the war. It is true that many Gazans supported Hamas and celebrated in the aftermath of the October 7th terrorist attacks, perhaps even a majority. But if they're out of Gaza many miles from Israel does it really matter? Would you prefer to kill 2 million people either quickly by bombing or slowly by mass starvation? It is true that Egypt and other Arab nation states are determined to keep those 2 million Gazans trapped in a warzone and have done for decades but Africa and the world is a big place. Is there really no territory on the planet that will take them in exchange for cash? Netanyahu has no answers to any of these questions and his lack of leadership is ensuring everyone loses. But sure, keep popping over to America with a new souvenir under your arm as Israelis and Gazans continue to die with no end in sight.

Ben-Gvir and Smotrich are in a difficult position. Understandably they don't want to trash Netanyahu's legacy. I'm sure they believe (as I do) that without Netanyahu who knows how much weaker a position Israel would be in today both militarily and economically? In addition, in a multitude of ways they owe their political careers to Netanyahu. The Overton window has shifted rightwards under Netanyahu's leadership and positions on a whole range of issues that were considered fringe earlier in Netanyahu's career are now considered universal wisdom within Israel. He has created the space for Ben-Gvir and Smotrich to take positions of responsibility in a coalition government when previously figures like Kahane struggled to even maintain a seat in the Knesset. However, despite all that, at some point a tough choice rears its head. Are you capable of succeeding him and advancing your own positions that might conflict with Netanyahu's traveling souvenir salesman approach or will you get dragged down with the ship? Ben-Gvir and Smotrich may feel like that time is not yet here and they need to continue to expand their electoral popularity remaining under Netanyahu's wing. There may be a broader long term military strategy in play and intelligence that I'm not aware of. But post the attacks on the Iranian nuclear sites and wars with Iranian proxies in Lebanon and elsewhere what exactly could that longer term strategy be and is it dependent on Netanyahu remaining leader? Elections have to be held in Israel by the end of 2026. Is that the time to go for broke or should they wait another election cycle? On a whole range of issues I personally believe Ben-Gvir and Smotrich present the most positive vision for a stronger Israel post October 7th rather than returning to October 6th weakness and being under the thumb of terrorists. But how to get there with a Israel's longest serving leader shaped obstacle in the way? 

I suspect the majority of the Israeli electorate and even the families of the fallen soldiers would accept casualties destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities or removing Hamas' ability to fire rockets into the Israeli mainland as the unfortunate but necessary cost of military action. Similarly I suspect they would accept casualties in a successful or failed attempt to save hostages who have been held in captivity in Gaza for approaching two years, just as Netanyahu had to come to terms with the death of his brother attempting to save hostages from Entebbe in 1976. Sending soldiers into the Gazan meat grinder to die with no obvious military objectives and no plan for removing the 2 million Gazan inhabitants to ensure a peaceful post October 7th world is however unacceptable. If Netanyahu considers it inevitable that those 2 million Gazans remain indefinitely and considers it inevitable that Gaza returns back to its October 6th state then Netanyahu might as well just admit his official policy is Gaza disengagement part 2 and stop with the façade that is killing Israeli soldiers for no reason. There is no peaceful end state where somehow Hamas is eradicated but those 2 million Gazans remain. It is impossible to identify where future Hamas fighters end and innocent Gazan civilians begin. But without a plan to remove them Netanyahu is just delaying the inevitable. Prevarication and evasiveness achieve nothing. Those who consider themselves innocent civilians need to be relocated and those who consider themselves Hamas fighters can choose to stay and fight a war they will lose. Those in the international community who want to whine about this being "ethnic cleansing" can justify why they were willing to keep 2 million Gazans trapped in a warzone for 2 years. And explain why in a supposed "genocide" there are still 2 million Gazans around to relocate. I personally much prefer the relocation option to the Hiroshima or Dresden option and think all options for relocation need to be explored and ruled out before the Hiroshima or Dresden option are even considered. But there will be a hell of a lot of blame to go round if those worst case scenarios end up occurring and top of the blame list will be Egypt for keeping Gazans trapped in a warzone and the Arab world for refusing to accept fellow Arab refugees into their countries to escape war.

## 73 The Temple Within

"We must remember that the details of the Temple are a model for and reflection of the inner structure of the human soul. For this reason, rebuilding the Temple is integral to and a manifestation of Redemption. It indicates the completion of our Divine mission, transforming the world into a dwelling place for G\*dliness. Obviously, then, we must not only understand the mystical relationship between the external Temple and our internal soul, but we must internalize the Divine service. We must translate the Temple's vessels and activities into our own. Rebuilding our inner Temple, our inner Holy Temple, is the first step toward rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem." Dovid Yisroel Ber Kaufman (based on the talks of the Lubavitcher Rebbe)

You should expect the enemy to say or do anything to defeat you, paralyze you or stunt your growth. The enemy is not doing their job effectively if they don't do everything in their power to achieve this. Sometimes it isn't clear whether a particular person or group of people is hovering around neutrality or is indeed a direct enemy. When it comes to the multitude of Arab nation states that surround Israel it sometimes isn't clear where they sit on this spectrum between neutrality and direct enemy. Iran has obviously been a direct enemy of Israel since the Islamic revolution in 1979. But Qatar? Saudi Arabia? They are supposedly allies of the United States (Qatar provided President Trump with a 400 million dollar luxury jetliner to be used as Air Force One for example) and the United States is Israel's most significant ally. By that logic surely Qatar and Saudi Arabia don't veer too far away from neutrality right? It depends on what you think Israel and Judaism should be. If you think Israel should be locked in an infinite war with a non-existent state with uncertain borders and have its strength and vitality permanently sapped by this infinite war then you could certainly argue that Qatar and Saudi Arabia are no worse than neutral. If you think Jews should never have sovereignty over their holiest site and to the extent that they are allowed up there at all they should worship in the direction of a golden Islamic shrine you could certainly argue that Qatar and Saudi Arabia are no worse than neutral. However, if you think Israel and Judaism should aim for more than this pitiful existence then the further you move away from those positions the more Qatar and Saudi Arabia start to look like direct enemies. This is why I think pursuing expansion of the Abraham Accords is a double edged sword and ultimately a waste of time. Declaring sovereignty over land in Gaza, Judea, Samaria and the Temple Mount and announcing your intention to start the rebuilding of the Third Temple only needs to happen once. Arab nation states in the Abraham Accords will never agree to it and so attempting to do this within the confines of the Abraham Accords seems like a recipe for a neverending pitiful existence status quo. But they're Arab nation states. You can't really expect them to be any better than neutral actors even in the best case scenario. There is a significant subset (if not a majority) of Arabs and Muslims in every Arab nation state that see the mere existence of Israel as an affront to their religious beliefs. In many cases they have been encouraged to believe this by their own leaders. That is not where the challenge or the opportunity lies. If fellow Jews can't be convinced that Israel and Judaism should aim for more than a pitiful existence it really doesn't matter what the direct enemies or quasi neutral observers think. A pitiful existence it shall remain.

Israel's political and religious leaders need to offer more. I'm not convinced that if Netanyahu was in power for another 50 years that he'd ever seek to change the status quo on the Temple Mount. Everything and anything would be perceived as more pressing and less worthy of expending political capital on either domestically or internationally. Ben-Gvir is the one who has pushed and continues to push the envelope on the Temple Mount. Even today on Tisha B'Av 2025, the day when Jews fast and commemorate the destruction of the first two temples, Ben-Gvir was breaking new ground as the first ever minister to lead prayers on Judaism's holiest site. Too many of Israel's secular political leaders today still see the Temple Mount as Moshe Dayan did in the aftermath of the Six Day War when he reportedly asked "What do I need all this Vatican for?" (Jerold Auerbach, JNS.org, "A tragic Israeli surrender"). Too many of Israel's religious leaders still subscribe to the view that Jews are helpless observers to fate and have no role to play in making Judaism's holiest site relevant again let alone restored to previous grandeur. It is this both unholy and holy alliance within Israel allied with the direct enemies and quasi neutral observers in the Arab world that will seek to ensure generation after generation are entirely dependent on the emergence of the Jewish Moshiach or a miracle from G\*d to save them. G\*d is capable of making things happen but G\*d is also capable of stopping things from happening. It is the height of complacency and pomposity to demand human inaction in the face of clear injustices and inferior outcomes because somehow that is what G\*d wants from you. Since when did "Leave everything for Moshiach to complete and stay exclusively at home reading books" become such an influential strand of Judaism?

"Through the studying about the Temple, on some level the Temple exists. And when we study about the Temple, it's as if we are building the Temple... that particularly when we can't see the Temple, it's so important, so significant to study about it, because that in fact builds the Temple. Perhaps it could be compared to an architect. Prior to building a building, you need to have drawings. One needs to go to engineers to get the papers done. And when studying about it and drawing it on the papers, it's actually as if you're building it. Building doesn't begin when the hammer hits the nail or when the wood delivery or stone delivery is made. So studying about the Temple is equivalent and brings about the building of the Temple on some level. In addition to that, studying about the Temple also causes a yearning. It's hard to yearn for something when you don't know what it is that you're yearning for. So when we study about the Temple, it enables us to properly desire and yearn for the rebuilding of the Holy Temple, the Third Holy Temple." Rabbi Levi Jacobson (chabad.org course on Inside G\*d's Home: The Holy Temple)

G\*d granted humans agency and generally the freedom to choose how they spend their time on this planet. Study is critically important. Without study one may never fully understand or appreciate wisdom from the divine or from ancient sages and one certainly can't build constructions in the world of atoms, world of bits or the world of the divine without study. But without application or at least circulation of that wisdom what you learn is wasted. It goes to the grave with you. This is what is so frustrating about so much of the religious leadership within Israel and certainly the modern day leadership of the Haredi in the Knesset. They want all the benefits of living in the modern day nation state of Israel with none of the responsibilities. They want endless financial handouts, universal exclusions from army service and to be put on a pedestal by the rest of the Israeli electorate without giving anything back. The leader of the Shas party, Aryeh Deri, was convicted of taking 155,000 dollars in bribes in 1999 and spent 3 years in prison so it is perhaps not a surprise that his prime focus since returning to politics has been taking secular, left wing positions, maximizing state handouts for his party's supporters and avoiding any responsibilites to contribute to the state. Deri has even discussed cooperation with secular left wing leaders to prevent Ben-Gvir and other Jews from visiting the Temple Mount (Times of Israel, August 2024). If the Haredi population was to remain a small minority then one could turn a blind eye to such weak and possibly corrupt leadership. However, with an average of seven children per family the Haredi population is projected to reach a third of the Israeli population by 2050 (Jerusalem Post, November 2021). Giving a third of the population military service exemptions and state handouts is not in any way sustainable not that Deri and the current Haredi leadership in the Knesset care. On nearly every political position they seem to take the opposite position to what "The Rebbe" advocated for, himself a Haredi rabbi (Hasidic). I don't know how this gets resolved or corrected but it is a significant and growing problem. It may need a higher quality of Haredi leader to make aliyah from abroad and dislodge the weak Haredi leadership within Israel. Whilst inspiring individuals like "The Rebbe" and Rabbi Levi Jacobson, who has put together an exceptional online course on "Inside G\*d's Home: The Holy Temple" on chabad.org, refuse to make aliyah to attempt to change Israel from within one hopes some viable alternatives can be found from within Israel.

"The fact that Adam was created from there, the fact that the world was created from there, this is where it all started. This is where the energy, the power and the strength, the glory of G\*d was experienced and seen, where Hashem expressed Himself most. And this is the natural place for Hashem to be seen and experienced once again. Look at the Beit Hamikdash as the soul is for the body, the Beit Hamikdash, the Holy Temple, is for the world." Rabbi Levi Jacobson

If the site of the Beit Hamikdash is as the soul is for the body then the soul in its current form has been almost entirely destroyed. There are the remains of a wall to remind oneself of where it used to be but nothing more. There is a single gate to access it from but your spiritual leaders forbid you from entering it. The soul must be controlled by Muslims and Muslims can tread over and sully the holiest parts of it with no repercussions. The few in public life who don't want to accept this reality and agitate for change and progress are demonized by their own soulless Jewish media. The soul of Judaism must be exclusively a place for suffering and regret for what happened thousands of years ago until a single Jew appears claiming to be the Jewish Moshiach. Until then Jews must stay at home, helpless, to work towards a brighter tomorrow and a plausible roadmap for the soul being restored its previous glory and grandeur. This cannot be Judaism. If it is it really should have died out millennia ago.

## 74 When the old man can't pull the trigger

"Perhaps we are all Aladdins, every novel idea is a kind of magic lamp able to bring forth the creative spirit... till it becomes obsolete. Perhaps herein lies the real achievement of victory when the victor becomes dispensable." Ze'ev Jabotinsky

The carcass of the two state solution still wriggling and lashing out lays before him. A mountain of Jewish (and Arab) corpses lies in its wake after decades of carnage. "It can still be revived. Its quality of life will be diminished but we can't live without it" Naftali Bennett insists. Arabs and Europeans in the pocket of the Arabs shriek from the sidelines "There will never be peace unless you keep this animal alive". President Trump looks over at him bemused "Isn't this what you worked your whole life for? This moment? I spent my first term thinking you were willing to pursue a two state solution. But you weren't. You won Bibi." Ben-Gvir takes a gun out of his holster and passes it to him. "It is only right you do this. You deserve this moment" he whispers in his ear. Netanyahu looks over at the Attorney General. "The Attorney General won't let me do it" he says. Ben-Gvir shakes his head. "The Supreme Court will put me in prison for years for accepting champagne as a gift" he says. Ben-Gvir shakes his head. "The Abraham Accords will fall apart if I do this" he says. Ben-Gvir shakes his head. "The UN...." Ben-Gvir shakes his head. "It can be given a pen and food. It won't pose a threat anymore. It won't do anymore harm. Regardless it isn't the right time. There are more intermediate steps that need to be followed before..." Ben-Gvir shakes his head and motions towards the gun. Netanyahu holds the gun up tentatively in the direction of the wriggling carcass. The Arab and European shrieking gets louder and louder. Netanyahu shakes his head and places the gun on the table. "It's not the right time" he insists. Ben-Gvir shrugs his shoulders. "So be it. Leave it to me Bibi" he sighs as he places his hand on his shoulder.

There is no halfway house despite Netanyahu constantly flailing for one. Either Gaza, Judea and Samaria are part of Israeli sovereign territory or they are placeholders for new, different nation state(s). After all the devastation and loss of life in Gaza it is insane to rebuild a placeholder for a new, different nation state controlled and governed by Arabs who can choose to pass it off to the Palestinian Authority or Hamas mark 2 at the time of their choosing. Absolutely insane. But if it isn't going to be Israeli sovereign territory that is the only intellectually honest alternative. It sounds harsh but if the Israeli electorate can't be convinced that it is a straight choice between sovereignty and reverting back to October 6th insanity then they don't deserve a viable nation state. They will deserve decades more of border uncertainty, intifadas and October 7ths. Stupidity, especially in the Middle East, is lethal. But it isn't just Israel and Gazans that are suffering through Netanyahu's flailing. There has never been and perhaps never will be again an American administration that is this supportive of Israel emerging from its "two state solution" nightmare once and for all. The longer the situation drags on and the more Netanyahu drags his heels the more images and news stories come out of Gaza that can be used to demonize Israel and Israel's allies. Trump and the Republicans cannot afford to continue to be dragged down by this constant barrage of "genocide" propaganda especially when Israel is not the sole American foreign policy priority and when there is a domestic policy agenda that is arguably the most challenging for almost a century. The situation is even more absurd given the Knesset and Netanyahu's own political party (Likud) voted to apply sovereignty in Judea and Samaria in July 2025. So that only leaves Gaza. A two state solution with Gaza as the second state? Or Israeli sovereignty over Gaza? It is your land or it isn't. It is part of Israel or it isn't. It is your responsibility or it isn't. You want more October 7ths or you don't. It really is that simple. I can only assume we are witnessing the results of age and being in power too long. There is no way a younger Netanyahu would look a gift horse in the mouth like this and desperately scramble round for any alternative other than the most obvious option and the only option that hasn't yet been tried. Sovereignty. Finality. Pull the damn trigger.

## 75 Designating space for the world of the divine

It requires strenuous and sustained effort to firstly carve out space in the world of atoms and world of bits for the world of the divine and then defend and preserve that space. Unlike the world of atoms and world of bits that in the modern world especially will frame and envelop your existence at all times (how many times per day does one think about collecting more money or Instagram notifications?) the world of the divine can only be experienced when you've expended the effort to create a space for it to enter. You can see this effort expended by Jews scurrying around the Jerusalem markets in the hours preceding the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat) before everything closes down at nightfall. This is an example of creating and preserving space in the calendar or the time dimension for the world of the divine. This seems to come naturally to many modern day Jews. The Hebrew essayist Ahad Ha'am famously stated that in exile from their land "More than Jews have kept Shabbat, Shabbat has kept the Jews". When it comes to defending and preserving space in the world of atoms on Temple Mount it seems to come less naturally. This is perhaps to be expected. Whilst Jews (generally) had access to and control of their time in exile it is a relatively new phenomenon to have the ability to access and control their holiest site. Many seem to not know what to do this newfound ability and would rather keep their heads in the sand, pretend they are still in exile and follow the advice of their ancestors who were never granted this ability. And yet the site of the Temple Mount sits there, accessible to Jews in a land that is once again (nominally at least) controlled by Jews. This week "There is a Holocaust in Gaza" graffiti in Hebrew was sprayed on the Western Wall reportedly by a young Haredi man (Times of Israel, August 11th 2025). It was admittedly a single man's actions and a sample size of one. However, it is emblematic of the problems created by leaving vacuums for foreign religions and ideologies to fill rather than defending and preserving spaces for the world of the divine. A vacuum in the mind of this self hating young Haredi man, a vacuum on what is supposedly the holiest site for Judaism and a vacuum in Gaza where inaction and indecisiveness increasingly leads to demonization from within and from afar. In Jerusalem and all over the world Jews lead the world in designating space for the world of the divine in the time dimension. But in the world of atoms and the world of the bits they are failing miserably. If you can't achieve it on your holiest site where can you achieve it?

It is the year 2100 CE or the Hebrew year 5860. A father takes his young son to the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem for the first time. "Today we are going to the holiest and most sacred place in the world", the father tells him. "The whole world?", the son asks inquisitively. "Yeah the whole world. This is where Hashem himself chooses to dwell." "Whoa. Why did Hashem choose here? Is it the best place? Is it better than Disneyland?" The father smiles, "For Hashem it is. Disneyland is fun for kids but this is Hashem's favorite place." They arrive within sight of the Western Wall and the father points towards the wall. "There it is", he says. "I can't see anything", the son says confused, "There's just a wall. What's behind the wall?" "We can't go behind the wall. That's where Hashem dwells", the father answers. "No one is allowed past the wall?", the son asks. "Some people are. Muslims are. Our rabbi forbids us." The son scrunches up his face. "Hashem allows the Muslims past the wall to get closer to him? But he doesn't want us Jews to get closer to him?". The father looks at his son sympathetically. "It is not like that son. We just have to wait for Moshiach and the Temple to be rebuilt." "What are the Muslims doing behind the wall? Are they going to rebuild the Temple for Moshiach?" The father sighs, "I don't know. Only Hashem knows." The son looks up at his father bemused and then at the wall. "Is Hashem punishing us?" The father shrugs his shoulders, "I don't know son. Let's go closer to the wall and pray for Moshiach." On the journey home the son looks at his father "I think Hashem should move to Disneyland. He'd have more fun there." The father smiles wryly, "Perhaps you're right son". They drive past a newspaper stand with the headline "Day 28,079 of the war: IDF bombs Gaza, 35 dead". A stand next to the newspaper stand is selling spray paint canisters on special offer.

It is the year 2100 CE or the Hebrew year 5860. A father takes his young son to the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem for the first time. "Today we are going to the holiest and most sacred place in the world", the father tells him. "The whole world?", the son asks inquisitively. "Yeah the whole world. This is where Hashem himself chooses to dwell." "Whoa. Why did Hashem choose here? Is it the best place? Is it better than Disneyland?" The father smiles, "You'll see. Look out the window. Mount Moriah should be coming into view soon." Sure enough as they turn the corner a stone structure built on top of Mount Moriah towering over all of Jerusalem comes into view. The father looks over at his son with his eyes glued out of the window as the car pulls into a parking space by a mikvah (ritual bath, מקוה) on the outskirts of Jerusalem, "C'mon. Let's prepare ourselves for Hashem".

## 76 A trip to the National Library

"I had found my religion: nothing seemed more important to me than a book. I saw the library as a temple." Jean-Paul Sartre

A week earlier the father had taken his son to the National Library in Jerusalem to see the "Rebuilding the Beit Hamikdash" exhibition. As they reached the entrance the father pointed out the stone exterior of the building, "Look how the stones have gaps in. The builders made it look like the Western Wall which we're going to next week. The light of Hashem shines through the cracks." They went through security and down the stairs to the exhibition. The first section documented the efforts of various Jews to keep the dream of rebuilding the Beit Hamikdash alive during the close to two millennia of exile. Chief among them was Maimonides ("The Rambam") who outlined the specifications for rebuilding the Holy Temple in exhaustive detail in his Mishneh Torah back in the 12th century CE. "Why did it take so long to build?", the son asked, "Did the Rambam think it would take a thousand years?" The father again smiled, "I don't think so. I think he would have been very sad to hear it would take a thousand years. But he did his part. He couldn't have done any more. I'm sure he's happy you are still asking about him after all this time." The second section focused on the reclaiming of the Temple Mount from one IDF paratrooper raising the Israeli flag on it during the Six Day War to another IDF paratrooper, Rabbi Yisrael Ariel, founding the Temple Institute and serving under Rabbi Meir Kahane in the Kach party to the Kach activist rising to the office of Prime Minister and declaring the end of the Islamic Waqf administration on the Temple Mount and full Jewish rights many decades after the initial flag raising. "I don't understand", the son said confused, "We won the Temple Mount in the Six Day War. Why did the Muslims control it after that?" "It seems to be the Jewish way", the father responded, "We turn military victories into political defeats. The soldiers act like lions and the politicians act like sheep. We have to try all the wrong options before we settle on the right one. Before Ben-Gvir became Prime Minister the Jewish media hated him for daring to pray on the Temple Mount as a Jew. Rabbi Meir Kahane was banned from the Knesset. Rabbi Yisrael Ariel was arrested for bowing down on the Temple Mount. We Jews are our own worst enemy. We are capable of sinning and turning away from Hashem just like everybody else. Thankfully Hashem never gave up on us despite it all." "If I was Hashem I would have given up", the son said indignantly. The father smiled, "One day you'll have a son. And he will do stupid things and rebel against you and rebel against Hashem. But you won't give up on him whatever he does. One day you'll rebel against me. But while I'm here I won't give up on you. And Hashem will never give up on you. C'mon let's move on to the next section. This is the fun part. This is where we rebuild the Beit Hamikdash."

"The Rebbe Reb Elimelech dreamed that the Third Temple was being rebuilt. And he saw millions of people -- or maybe they were angels -- running around, working like crazy. So he stopped one of the angels and said "You are wasting so much time. If you had fewer people who wouldn't fall all over each other, you could be finished so much faster." The angel laughed at him and said, "You don't understand, Reb Elimelech. G\*d wants as many people as possible to have a part in the rebuilding of the Beit Hamikdash..." Teachings of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach (The Soul of Jerusalem)

The next section of the exhibition focused on the actual rebuilding from the ceremony for the first stone laid to the evolution of the architectural plans and the miniature scale models housed at the Israel Museum round the corner from the National Library. The father led his son to a computerized touchscreen. "Can you type your surname in?", he asked. With some assistance the son pressed the Hebrew letters of his surname before pressing enter. "Do you recognize him?", the father asked with a pause, "It is your grandfather". "Whoa", the son exclaimed, "What is saba (סבא) doing here?" "He laid a stone in the rebuilding of the Holy Temple", the father responded as he navigated from the photo to the page displaying the location of the stone that the grandfather had laid. The user interface and database search functionality had been reused with minor modifications from the Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Remembrance Center on Mount Herzl. Jewish visitors to Jerusalem could now go from looking up their ancestors' involvement in the Holocaust at Yad Vashem to looking up their more recent ancestors' involvement in the rebuilding of the Holy Temple. "Next week we'll try to find the exact location of the stone your grandfather laid", the father told the son, "He'd have wanted you to see it". On the way out of the exhibition something caught the son's eye in the National Library shop. He pointed to it and asked expectantly, "Can we get it? I want to be like saba." The father looked up. It was a do-it-yourself craft kit for building a model of the Holy Temple.

The father watched his son play with his toys. The days were passing and dust was gathering on the unopened do-it-yourself craft kit on the shelf. The father was anxious that his son assemble it before their visit to the Holy Temple but didn't want to apply any pressure or even persuasion to do so. He wanted his son to associate the activity with a continuance of self directed play under free will rather than imposing his own will on his son's playtime activities and the son blindly following instructions by rote. But at the same time he didn't know how crowded it would be on their upcoming visit and how many of the inner sanctums of the Holy Temple they would be able to see. If the son was familiar with the general layout prior to the visit it wouldn't matter too much. He would at least have a mental model of the entire area and a frame of reference for the parts that were accessible and viewable to general visitors. Hopefully this would sustain the son's interest on the day rather than trudging around crowded areas feeling like a chore. But the son continued playing with his toys oblivious to the restless machinations in his father's mind. And the clock on the wall kept ticking closer and closer to their scheduled visit. The mother walked in. "What's this?", she asked, holding up the unopened craft kit. "It's the Beit Hamikdash", the son answered, "I'm going to build it like saba." "You're going to build it? Wow. I hope it doesn't take you as long as it took to build the actual one. Want to start now?" The son nodded and the mother opened up the packaging. 
## 77 Assembling the Holy Temple

"If Jews cannot get to the holy places, the holy places will come to them." Hans Kroch

In 1962 (Hebrew year 5722) Hans Kroch, the builder and owner of the Holyland Hotel in Jerusalem, approached Michael Avi-Yonah, professor of Archaeology at the Hebrew University, with a proposal to build an ambitiously sized model of Second Temple Jerusalem at a scale of 1:50 (2 centimeters representing a life-sized meter). Kroch wanted to dedicate it to the memory of his son Jacob who had fell in the 1948 War of Independence defending his kibbutz (Nitzanim) against Egyptian attack. At the time of the proposal, five years before the Six Day War, Jordan controlled East Jerusalem, the Old City and the Temple Mount and Jews were blocked from accessing them by thick concrete walls. A year after the model was completed and opened to the public the Six Day War was fought, the walls came down and Jews could once again walk freely around the entirety of Jerusalem as if they were Lego minifigures in Kroch's model. The model took four years to build and consisted of over five million tiny stone blocks with the Holy Temple and its courts requiring 650 columns molded in fiberglass and covered with gold leaf (Model of Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period, David Amit). It was assembled according to the prevailing understanding of Second Temple Jerusalem but after the model was completed and the Six Day War opened Jerusalem up to archaeological excavations more and more sections of the model were found to be historically inaccurate. A feedback loop developed where archaelogists would study parts of the model, carry out excavations at those sites, make new discoveries and submit proposals to Avi-Yonah to update his model. Although the cost of making changes to his model was prohibitive and interpretations of new discoveries often conflicted Avi-Yonah and his successors did make changes when the interpretations were proved beyond reasonable doubt and the passage of time did not throw up any more counterfactuals. Indeed before his death in 1974 (Hebrew year 5734) he began the redesign of the area to the south of the Temple Mount after some consequential discoveries were made in one particular excavation. Avi-Yonah was not rigidly protective of the veracity of his model, was transparent about which areas of it were more speculative, stayed true to the spirit of the scientific process and unlike broad swathes of the Islamic world and a subset of Jewish rabbis welcomed the pursuit towards a greater human understanding of Judaism's holiest sites.

The Israel Museum opened in 1965 (Hebrew year 5725) adjacent to the sites of the Knesset (opened in 1966), Supreme Court (opened in 1992) and the National Library (newest building opened in 2023). This was too late to be considered for the original site of Kroch's model, it was initially assembled on the grounds of Kroch's Holyland Hotel, but when an alternative site was sought away from planned developments the spacious 20 acre grounds of the Israel Museum were considered most suitable. The relaxed spatial constraints of the new site allowed for sculpting of the terrain to more closely resemble the landscape of the original city with valleys binding it on the east, south and west. Once this was completed attention turned to the transferring of the actual model requiring it to be chiseled into around 1,000 sections, transported and reassembled on top of the relevant contours. It reopened to public visitors at its permanent home within the grounds of the Israel Museum in 2006 (Hebrew year 5766). When thinking ahead to the building of Third Temple Jerusalem this exercise provides a template for thinking about the role of models, the deconstruction, transportation and possible reassembly at alternative sites of Islamic monuments such as the Dome of the Rock and the necessary preparation of the landscape on Temple Mount before the first stone can be laid. Although the transfer of Kroch's model required meticulous planning and delicate handling it wasn't overseen by the prominent rabbis and halakhic authorities of Israel's religious communities which clearly adds another dimension of complexity and a myriad of divergent views to an already fractious task. However, Kroch in collaboration with Avi-Yonah brought to life Second Temple Jerusalem and fulfilled the Torah commandment to build a Temple, if only a small one, adjacent to the land that Second Temple Jerusalem once stood. This is the first step to transitioning from paper to reality, from the exiled "people of the book" to the returned people of builders on their own land and ultimately bringing the world of atoms back into the world of the divine.

"When it comes to laying the foundation of a building, it is of no concern what neighbors or passersby might think of the outer attractiveness of the foundation, much less what scoffers might say about it. What is important is that the foundation be of tested and durable material that can withstand any erosive elements, and that it should be strong enough to support the upper floors that will be added to it. The same is true of the foundations of Torah and mitzvot. There is no better test than actual experience, and our Jewish people have the wisdom and conviction of thousands of years of experience, ever since Matan Torah at Sinai, that it is adherence to the Torah and mitzvot in the daily life that have preserved our people - both collectively and individually - through all possible crises, and made us the Eternal People." The Lubavitcher Rebbe (letter from "The Rebbe" to a newlywed couple)

"So where do we start?", the mother asked her son, "What comes first?". The son's attention seemed to be captured by a golden Menorah, the gold plated Ark of the Covenant and a golden door. "We need strong foundations and a strong base" she told him, "We don't want the Beit Hamikdash to fall down." The son nodded. "We're lucky. Saba and his friends had to first remove a golden dome before they could start on the base. Moses had to stop Jews worshipping a golden calf. Saba had to stop Jews worshipping a golden dome the Muslims had put there. We seem to have a problem with gold. Open this up." She passed him the base to open up and extend. "What do you think?", the mother asked, "Do you think this base is strong enough to keep the Beit Hamikdash standing forever?" The son seemed unsure. "How big is the Beit Hamikdash?", he responded. "Good question. Pretty big. Hashem wants it to be seen from all across Jerusalem. Let's add a second base on top of this first one to make sure. Fold these flaps and put them in the slots of the first base."

## 78 Welcome to Israel. Welcome to the problem

On September 30th 2025, the day before Judaism's holiest day of the year (Yom Kippur) started and a week before the two year anniversary of the October 7th terrorist attacks, I received my Israeli identity card (Teudat Zehut, תעודת זהות). That date will henceforth be the date I made aliyah to Israel and became an Israeli citizen although I don't receive my Israeli passport for another three months. Having entered Israel in April 2025 for potentially the last attempt at obtaining Israeli citizenship and remaining for almost six months through Iranian missile bombardments (is President Trump's Twelve Day War branding sticking?) and the occasional terrorist attack I had finally received a piece of laminated card with an ID number and a photo of my face that gives me the right to stay (and work) in Israel indefinitely. After years of struggling unsuccessfully to convince various UK rabbis to give me the Proof of Judaism letter required to apply for Israeli citizenship and six years since entering Israel for the first time on an all expenses paid Birthright trip, a multiyear period in which I was hedging my bets during optimistic phases and downright writing off my chances during pessimistic phases, I had finally achieved the goal. Unlike those who successfully finalize the aliyah process abroad, take their Israeli taxpayer funded one-way aliyah flight and pose for photos with Israeli flags and slogan boards by the plane at Ben Gurion airport with a flight load of others also making aliyah or more dramatically the former American spy Jonathan Pollard who kissed the airport tarmac before being greeted by Prime Minister Netanyahu I received my identity card in a dingy basement office in Tel Aviv with two presumably government employees sitting behind a desk rearranging stacks of forms and documents. One passed over my identity card and said "Welcome to Israel". The other laughed and said "Welcome to the problem". It wasn't a joyful or climactic experience. But after ten years of wrestling with the American and Israeli visa and immigration systems I did not care in the slightest. Anything else would not have been on-brand for my life. If anything, having mentally prepared for another setback on the day my extended war visa was expiring and tensing my metaphorical stomach for yet another gut punch it was a relief when none came. On Yom Kippur an appropriately named Muslim individual by the name of "Jihad" (Al-Shamie) mowed down and stabbed Jewish worshippers outside a Manchester synagogue whilst on bail for a suspected rape and the UK media was quick to blame mental illness, the "far right" stoking animosity and/or Israel's wars for "Jihad"'s actions. Anything to avoid offending the UK's effective owners and ruling classes wearing keffiyeh headscarves in the Middle East. If Israel is a "problem" I don't know what word you'd use to describe the UK in its current state. Welcome to the problem? As Marlo Stanfield would say in The Wire "Sound like one of dem good problems".

The first step recommended by the Jewish Agency post receiving the Israeli identity card is to open a Israeli bank account to amongst other things receive Sal Klita (סל קליטה, absorption basket) payments in shekels from the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration. These payments are intended to assist new immigrants with rental costs and Hebrew study within the first year of living in Israel. To receive these payments you obviously need to choose a bank and a branch. The largest banks in Israel are Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim who together, as of September 2022, hold a market share of approximately 60 percent when measured in terms of total system assets. As I write this in October 2025 Bank Leumi is valued (market capitalization) at approximately 92 billion shekels (28 billion US dollars) and Bank Hapoalim is valued at approximately 82 billion shekels (25 billion US dollars). When compared to the United States' largest bank, J.P. Morgan Chase (market capitalization of 800 billion US dollars), the United Kingdom's largest bank, HSBC (220 billion US dollars) and Australia's largest bank, Commonwealth Bank (183 billion US dollars) you can appreciate how small they are in a global context. This is at least partly explained by the population size of Israel (approximately 10 million people versus Australia's 27 million people) and Israel's relative youth (modern day nation state founded in 1948 versus Australia's 1901). Though other factors such as historical trade embargoes, being surrounded by generally hostile Arab nation states rather than relatively benign Asian nation states leading to a prioritization of other industries (e.g. defense) and perhaps global financial markets maturing before Israel's banking sector was able to get off the ground has led to a Israeli banking sector primarily focused on its small domestic market. With the Rothschild family historically playing such a pivotal role in obtaining the Balfour Declaration and funding the building of Israeli public institutions it is perhaps surprising that even in the investment banking realm the modern day Rothschild & Co. presence in Israel seems relatively limited. Does any of this matter? Should I randomly pick an Israeli retail bank, only use it when forced to pay or receive in shekels and instead continue to primarily use UK banking and Bitcoin services that charge less in fees? Is Israel's banking sector destined to always be small, domestic focused, unable to expand overseas, relatively bureaucratic and not a focus for growth or technological innovation? It does seem strange for a Jewish nation state with centuries of prominent Jewish bankers in the diaspora (Rothschild, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Saloman Brothers etc) to relegate the financial sector to a sideshow. But then maybe that's a sector for American Jews and not Israeli Jews where the Israel stigma doesn't dampen the profits of companies founded and named after Jewish bankers.

I booked an appointment online to set up a bank account at Bank Hapoalim in Jerusalem. With my limited Hebrew taking photos of Hebrew text and uploading them to Google Translate for English translations is a technological g*dsend though many Israeli websites have English translations too. The Bank Hapoalim website is functional and perhaps no worse than the websites for some of the less technologically advanced incumbents I'm used to in the UK. With its small domestic market Israel doesn't seem to have experienced the challenger bank wave that the UK experienced in the 2010s with FinTech startups like Monzo, Revolut and Starling providing slick online and mobile experiences but with no physical branches and limited capacity to lend and issue mortgages. The in person bank account setup bureaucracy at Bank Hapoalim took a while, approximately 45 minutes, though the bank employee (Yisrael?) was very friendly and seemed pleasantly surprised there was a new immigrant opening a bank account with him. He asked what I did for work in broken English and I replied "Software, programming, computers" to which he responded "Ah, hi-tech" which sums up how banking isn't (yet) perceived as part of the technology (FinTech) sector in Israel. On completion of the paperwork he smiled and said "New bank account in Jerusalem. Baruch Hashem (ברוך השם, Blessed be G\*d)." Only in Israel. There's an interesting quirk with my name too that could be problematic with state bureaucracy in future. Michael (מיכאל) is fine, it is a Hebrew name that translates to "Who is like G\*d?" or "There is none like G\*d". But Folkson (פולקסון) has no Hebrew meaning and was spelt Fokson (פוקסון) without the "l" or "ל" (lamed) on my Israeli identity card. This is ironic because my Jewish ancestors changed their name from Falkson (with an "a") to Folkson (with an "o") when moving to the UK from modern day Latvia in the early 20th century. Do I keep my Hebrew surname as Fokson (פוקסון), put the "l" ("ל", lamed) back in, or change it to something else entirely? I don't have much time to decide, the Israeli state bureaucracy hasn't defeated me yet but it is asking for trouble if I let different spellings of my surname circulate on state documents and in state and banking computer systems. Still I have a bank account set up in a Jerusalem branch, it has a minimal amount of shekels in it and although the process certainly wasn't lightning fast it had a certain personal charm to it. Baruch Hashem indeed.

## 79 Israel's role in the global village

With the advent and propagation of the internet and social media platforms the world seemed to become smaller, more and more interconnected and increasingly resembled and was referred to as a "global village". The term was originally coined by Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan in the 1960s. As the world continues to shrink and American power over the internet and social media platforms cements itself to such an extent that the Americans can control information flow globally with impunity countries that don't accept their limited remit in this American controlled global village are going to come to a crossroads. One of the first countries to come to this crossroads will undoubtedly be Israel. The American remit for Israel is the effective church or synagogue of this global village engulfed in interminable conflicts with crazed jihadists to provide a sandbox for trying out the latest military technology in a perpetually hot environment. Unlike the mosque of this global village in Saudi Arabia, which must be protected from this chaos and bloodshed at all costs because that's where oil billionaires permanently live, the rich, powerful Americans can fly into visit the church or synagogue of this global village when there is a lull in hostilities and then fly back before they erupt again. There is a role for Israel in this global village but it is permanently dependent on the Americans for funding and donations, just like a church or synagogue is not able to independently financially sustain itself, and when the fighting gets too intense or the risk becomes too existential it leans on the Americans to ensure the church or synagogue of this global village doesn't get destroyed. The Americans won't let Israel be destroyed, the rich and powerful don't want the village church or synagogue to be destroyed, but they also don't want it straying into matters that a church or synagogue shouldn't concern itself. Money and power emanate from elsewhere in a partnership between the American billionaires and the Arab billionaires and the Chinese and Russian billionaires can be included in the partnership when their countries fulfill their global village remits. Wealthy American Jews may or may not want more for Israel than it has been given in its remit but given they don't plan to make permanent aliyah to Israel they would rather protect their wealth and power in the United States and not rock the boat. They can settle for the village synagogue not being destroyed, visiting during lulls in hostilities and sending some donations over to convince themselves they are being good Jews. What Israeli Jews will have to decide is whether they are willing to accept this remit in the global village going forward, especially as Israel's ceiling could be so much higher in a world where remits weren't allocated and actual capitalism, rather than faux olipolistic capitalism, was allowed to flourish. In theory Israel could emerge from post October 7th wars with relative stability on its borders, clear sovereignty over previously disputed lands in Gaza, Judea and Samaria (West Bank) and unleash a wave of human capital into a new iteration of startup nation. But in the global village that is not what the Americans and certainly not the Arabs want for Israel. The instability and uncertainty in Gaza, Judea and Samaria are by design. The global village church or synagogue can't get ideas above its station and return to innovating in fields that are now sewn up by American oligopolies if they are pemanently bogged down in 20 point peace plans and fretting about soldiers from nations that want Israel destroyed patrolling the streets of Gaza. All the living hostages may have returned from Gaza as I write this (baruch hashem) but after promising early signs and military successes, most impressively in Iran, the Trump administration is reverting to type and pursuing the same restraining of Israel foreign policy as a multitude of its predecessors. Gaza returning to its October 6th state now seems an inevitability via elaborate multi pointed peace plans and already wealthy Americans pandering to Arabs for yet more financial gain. And when Israel emerges from post October 7th wars (too premature to assume it is already) it may just find the world has become even smaller and its remit in the global village yet more constrained.

If the conflicts between Israel and Iran, Russia and Ukraine and China and Taiwan were all part of a 4-6 year world war like World War 1 and World War 2 there would be an argument to take American orders, keep the American oligopolies in place and make sure the American side won the war. But the introduction of nuclear weapons has changed the game. It is not clear how a world war would be won within 4-6 years without superpowers firing nuclear weapons at each other. Instead long, drawn out cold wars with semi-regular hot (not too hot) flare ups seems to be the inevitable long term future in the same vein as skirmishes between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia in George Orwell's 1984. In this scenario if you meekly take American orders for long cold war periods like a meek poodle it is not long before you turn into the UK of the 2025, teetering on national bankruptcy and failed state status. American interests are and never were perfectly aligned with British interests and the same is the case for the United States and Israel. Netanyahu has stood up for Israeli interests much better in the last two decades than any British leader since Thatcher but no Israeli leader can afford to take their foot off the gas. If there isn't what appears to be excessive friction between these supposed allies the Israeli leader isn't doing their job. Israel's story, 77 years in, is nowhere near finished even if the United States is just interested in maintaining its pre-eminent superpower status from the 20th century. You would hope Israel doesn't literally have to fight off American suffocation in a War of Independence like the Americans had to do with the British in the 18th century but American restraining of Israel is not going away. Meekly accepting failed vassal state status as the impoverished village church or synagogue seems to me to be the bigger risk. 

"When you look at the map of the Middle East Israel is a tiny little spot compared to these giant land masses. It's really a tiny spot. I actually said is there any way of getting more. It is so tiny." President Trump (August 2024)

"It is a small country in terms of land. See this pen, this wonderful pen. My desk is the Middle East and this pen, the top of the pen, is Israel. That's not good. It is a pretty big difference. I use that as an analogy. It's pretty accurate actually. It is a pretty small piece of land. It is amazing that they've been able to do what they've been able to do when you think about it. A lot of good, smart brainpower." President Trump (February 2025)

 "I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now. Ok?" President Trump (September 2025)

"The policy of President Trump is that the West Bank will not be annexed. This will always be our policy." Vice President Vance (October 2025)

In the world of politics words often aren't worth the paper they are written on. Dominic Cummings described Boris Johnson as a "shopping trolley smashing between aisles" during Covid and with a 400 million dollar Qatari jet sitting in President Trump's shopping trolley from earlier in the year it isn't surprising that his trolley has since lurched in a pro Qatari position. Concerns over Israel's long term security and being too "tiny" evaporated pretty quickly. If sovereignty over Gaza, Judea and Samaria aren't the solution to Israel being too "tiny" what exactly is the solution? But then J.D. Vance is now the Vice President to the individual he previously described as "America's Hitler" so if you want some consistency get a dog? Perhaps becoming the von Papen to America's Hitler became too alluring a proposition. Assuming there isn't another shopping trolley swerve (and perhaps even if there is, what value is a Jekyll and Hyde ally?) a turning point has definitely been reached in US, Israeli relations. After struggling through four years of Biden's ramblings warning Israel not to pursue Hamas leader Sinwar in Rafah, southern Gaza the light at the end of the tunnel was a returning Trump and/or Republican adminstration that wanted a stronger, larger Israel and even introduced American legislation recognizing Judea and Samaria as land that Jews have legal and historic rights to and prohibiting the use of the term "West Bank" in US government documents (RECOGNIZING Judea and Samaria Act, 2025). Presumably deep in that legislation is a carve out for the President and the Vice President to do so. The previous hypothesis was that although Israel could no longer rely on Democrat administrations (Biden, Obama etc) in the United States it just had to wait for a Republican administration that under Trump had turned even more pro Israel than before. That hypothesis clearly no longer stands up to scrutiny. The frontrunners for Trump's successor at the time of writing, the Vice President and the Secretary of State (Marco Rubio), are fully signed up to this shopping trolley lurch. Netanyahu should not escape blame. When the American iron was hot and firing on pro Israel cylinders earlier in the year he didn't capitalize. Now it is cold and it is back to Netanyahu and Biden old men squabbling mode. The "Trump induced window of opportunity" I described earlier has passed and on Gaza, Judea and Samaria nothing has changed. Not only that but it looks like Netanyahu will be rewarded for doing nothing with another election win. You've gotta love politics.

## 80 Is Israel smart enough for where the world is headed?

"It [US abandoning Israel] would force Israel to seek new partners, likely including China... Israel is also on Beijing's shopping list. Push Israel away and China will welcome it. A Chinese-Israeli technological partnership would be a nightmare for America combining Israeli innovation with Chinese scale. America's alliance with Israel is not sentimental. It is strategic. While Israel benefits from American support, America benefits from Israel's considerable capabilities. In the Middle East no ally is stronger, more dependable or more aligned with American interest than Israel." Michael Doran, Is Israel a liability? (Prager University)

"We are certainly in the midst of a great transition to a multi-polar world, a post American order and a multi-polar world. No one can tell how the transition will unfold but there is no doubt it will be messy and unpredicatable because America is stepping back from its role as global insurer but there is no other country that's able to or willing to fill the vacuum. So we are in an uncomfortable position where the old rules do not apply anymore but the new ones have not been written. And we must brace ourselves for more turbulence ahead. So what are we to do in this environment? I think we cannot afford to just wait for things to happen or hope somehow that things magically will fall in place. We have to take actions now, plan now and start taking actions to invest together in tackling the problems of the global commons or in building new trade connections and keeping up the momentum of trade liberalisation. So that's something that Singapore is keen to do. We can't do it alone but we will do it with other like-minded countries." Lawrence Wong, Singapore Prime Minister (Financial Times interview, October 2025)

Every nation state has two faces: a front end that it presents to the domestic and international public and a back end that is generally private. The back end would encompass the intelligence services and the military to the extent that no nation state should want to leak critical military secrets to an adversary. When it comes to Israel's backend I have next to zero knowledge of how it operates but enough details bubble up to the public surface on successful operations such as the Stuxnet cyber attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities (2010), the pager supply chain attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon (2024) and the infiltration of Mossad cells deep inside Iran prior to the Twelve Day War (ok let's go with Trump's branding) in 2025 that the back end doesn't present a concern. One can never be complacent but at least as of 2025 it seems to be able to achieve things that require the highest levels of competence. The front end however really worries me. Everything is relative, Israel's front end is better than the UK's, a circus group of monkeys could offer a superior front end to the UK's and it is not clear that the UK's back end is much better than its front end. It is a relatively recent phenomenon in the West that the front end isn't treated seriously, it is effective entertainment and a reality TV show which Trump is perfect for after his lifetime of TV appearances including on "The Apprentice". In the UK Boris Johnson had a similar route to Brexit and the ascent to Prime Minister with regular appearances on TV series like "Have I Got News For You?". When I was younger I used to think this was a sign of strength, the Western peacock displaying its colorful feathers in complete contrast to a cold but highly competent back end. A message to the rest of the world that whilst leaders outside of the West boringly justified the results of their country's back ends the West could afford to put on an elaborate distracting show. Although generally considering itself part of the West, despite its location outside Europe and Northern America, Israel in the 20th century couldn't afford to expend valuable resources on peacock feathers and elaborate public shows surrounded by existential military threats. Its front end has more resembled the front ends outside of the West where to the extent it exists at all it is to justify the results of the back end. When wars are being fought and terrorists are blowing up buses there is already sufficient "entertainment". In 2025 though, halfway through the 2020s decade, things are most definitely a-changin' globally. Whether it is the Covid pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Iran war, mass immigration, a reshaping of global trade with Trump tariffs, a collapse in the legitimacy of global institutions like the United Nations and reassessments on foreign policy that haven't been considered since World War 2 everything is up in the air. Maybe, maybe the United States can still afford the peacock act though its fiscal situation suggests otherwise. But no one else in the West can. When everything is up in the air, including the very viability of your nation state in the 21st century and beyond, peacock front ends don't project strength. Especially when the back end seems to be failing.

As I've already stated the signs are that Israel's back end is not failing, quite the contrary. But the front end is a real concern. In normal times Israel could spend a few years recovering from the national trauma of the October 7th terrorist attacks and the resulting wars. But in the 2020s where the global chess pieces and sands are shifting so rapidly it really can't afford to. Just in 2025 the American Israeli alliance has gone from seemingly ushering in a new golden era of relations and collaboration with the bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities and alignment over the future of Gaza, Judea and Samaria to the complete opposite. It has gone from the Americans rejecting a two state solution at the United Nations to rejecting Israeli sovereignty over that same land, "always" if you believe Vice President Vance. The shopping trolley movements are enough to give one whiplash. The Americans can maybe afford the shopping trolley movements just as it (maybe) can still afford its peacock front end, perhaps Trump has even landed on a deliberate and correct whiplash strategy for American allies and adversaries, but the Israelis cannot afford it. It needs to communicate and implement a coherent strategy if it is to have one other than Netanyahu meekly following Trump's orders as America's new favorite poodle and accepting its place in the pecking order of the American controlled global village. There are zero signs Netanyahu, his administration or perhaps even anyone in the political arena is capable of this. The Israeli media and public conversation is focused on Trump sycophantism after he managed to get some hostages in Gaza back after two years, a total irrelevance in the broader national security and geopolitical trends. The gap between the competence of Israel's front end and the apparent competence of Israel's back end is absolutely yawning and getting bigger. The similarities with the UK in the early 2000s post September 11th terrorist attacks when the UK basked in its special relationship with the United States are freaking me out. I've seen how that story ends. Have I swapped one country with another country that is about to repeat the same mistakes post October 7th terrorist attacks?

If Trump foreign policy can be bought by the highest bidder it really does not bode well for Taiwan. Israel has just engaged multiple surrounding enemies that want to see it wiped out, on its own with very limited American involvement and emerged stronger with a number of military successes. If the United States abandoned Israel after a high bid from a Qatari, Arab consortium it would be deeply concerning and require a swift reorientation that Israel may not be capable of but if the United States abandoned Taiwan after a high bid from China it is hard to see how Taiwan could fend off Chinese advances in the best case scenario. Even Ukraine has largely fought off the Russians in sustained fighting for three years and has the option of surrendering some of its land (Luhansk, Donetsk etc) in a peace deal. Taiwan does not have this option as a small island, nor has it engaged China yet in a hot warfare environment. For the first time in decades the United States has a President seemingly willing to abandon American foreign policy orthodoxy on his volatile shopping trolley expeditions when anything other than a watertight American backstop seems like it would be curtains for Taiwanese aspirations to be a viable independent nation state. The American back end (intelligence services etc) would understand deeply the cost of surrending Taiwanese computer chip fabrication plants to China but it is not clear if a former property developer and former TV celebrity would be as familiar with the technological details, assuming as commander-in-chief he makes the final decision. The option that may be available to Taiwan that isn't available to Israel is a coalition of neighbors (Japan, Philippines, Indonesia etc) grouping together and declaring they will attempt to defend the integrity of the first island chain in East Asia but this currently seems like a pipe dream. If the United States was to abandon the first island chain one would expect that the focus would turn to ensuring the United States reinforced the second island chain and the effective abandonment of Taiwan. An Israel that was smart enough for where the world is possibly headed would be engaging with these issues and thinking through the ramifications: both geopolitical and industrial; to construct a national policy for long term computer chip production and partnerships with Asian countries where beneficial. The Israel of today is squabbling with Trump over whether Turkish troops should be patrolling Gaza or not. (Plot twist: no they shouldn't, that would be like having Chinese troops patrolling the US-Mexico border.) 

## 81 The ultra bullish case for Israel as superpower in the 21st century

"The question is what happens then when Israel controls the Persian Gulf, the Suez, they control this land mass in the center of Asia, Europe and Africa. All these Belt and Road highways and ports and sea routes. The IMEC, the India-Middle East-Europe (Economic) Corridor, all of that will be under their control. I think it is not farfetched to say this is like a play for superpower status. People can say they are a tiny country with a small population. So was Great Britain. Great Britain was a tiny island. In the era of AI and technology and spying... This is something like a global empire, like a King Solomon, every country is coming to pay tribute. They sit in the center of the world island, the crossroads between all the critical minerals, the world's industry and China." Nick Fuentes on Alex Jones' Infowars

"[If] the Israelis prevail and Iran falls we are talking about an era in history where Israel dominates the entire Middle East. They are unchained from the United States... What happens on the other side of the fall of Iran and the total conquest and domination of the Middle East by Israel is that they become the world power." Nick Fuentes on America First

"Society is coming apart, has been coming apart. We are in the age of complexity and we have been for a long time. Whether you call it modernism, postmodernism, the quantum age, people have realized that things are starting to fall apart. What is interesting about the Israelis is they were writing about this in the 1980s. There is a doctrine (A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s) by one of their planners named Oded Yinon, he wrote it for a future Prime Minister of Israel in the 1980s. In that plan they talk about their strategy for the Middle East, in there is talking about Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Iraq and Iran, their adversaries, but what a lot of people miss... in there they say our big enemy is not the Arabs, it is not even the Soviets that give them weapons, they said the big enemy is this modernism that is coming apart. The reason that we are going to survive is because we are going to be strong. Although we are small and few in number, although we don't have a big country or a lot of territory we are solid, we are together, we have a sense of who we are, we are concrete, defined. Whereas the rest of the world is going to be ripping each other apart over ideology, over ethnicity, all these different cleavages, we are going to be strong... That is going to be the superpower in this century, organization. Who can actually direct and focus the energy of a large group of people effectively... In these big, diverse countries, in this complex globalized world with ideology, few, even a great and large and mighty country like America, can effectively do that anymore. If America comes apart who will be the strong horse...?" Nick Fuentes

It is deeply ironic but the one with the most ambitious vision for Israel in the 21st century, publicly at least, is the American, Catholic, non-Jewish internet celebrity with a talk show on one of the few platforms (Rumble) that isn't censoring him for being antisemitic, racist and far right. In the world that the Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong describes, "a multi-polar world", "a post American order" leaving a "vacuum" that no other country is able or willing to fill, accepting the role of church or synagogue in the American controlled global village and being lectured by the American Vice President on what votes Israel's Parliament (Knesset) can conduct on domestic affairs that aren't a "stupid political exercise", "strange" and offensive to the global village's visiting Vice Emperor is selling Israel short, there's no doubt. But Israel is today, on the front end at least, so far from being able to fulfil anything close to the vision Fuentes puts forward for what Israel could be in the 21st century. It doesn't see itself or project itself as a potential aspiring superpower. The propaganda war exercised on American owned and controlled (funny that?) online platforms since the October 7th terrorist attacks accusing Israel of "genocide", "starvation" and "ethnic cleansing" in Gaza have taken their toll on the national psyche (something that **was** encouraged and whipped up by Fuentes). The obsequiousness displayed whenever an American politician or celebrity visits Israel projects weakness and second class global village citizen status. This is Netanyahu's Israel. Where Israel is dependent on Netanyahu to be a bridge to the United States and hence can't afford to discard Netanyahu at elections. Without that Netanyahu bridge and without the support of the global village's first class citizens flying in for a photo opportunity Israel is not a viable, independent nation state. It is the Middle Eastern Taiwan, just with no neighbors that would consider banding together to fight off the regional hegemon. I personally think Wong's declaration of a post American order is premature even though Trump foreign policy on auction to the highest bidder and Vance trying to project Vice Emperor status in Israel have forced me to reassess my priors. But if you combine the Wong view with the Fuentes view on what Israel could be you can't fail but see the massive opportunity if only Israel could raise its game and actually believe in itself.  

## 82 A Jewish state, if you can keep it

It was the American socialite Elizabeth Willing Powel who according to historical record asked Benjamin Franklin whether he had helped form a republic or monarchy and prompted his famous quote "A republic, if you can keep it." In 2025 it is not obvious that Silicon Valley billionaires or indeed President Trump himself, those with American money and power, care enough about keeping it. There is a personal cost to doing what is right for your country and that cost is vastly elevated during critical times. Pursuing self interest entirely or even partially, cementing your oligopoly or transitioning to trillionaire status from billionaire status, when your country is suffering economic, demographic and ideological convulsions is not going to be sufficient to keep that republic intact. A country in an existential war is not going to win that war if its generals have even half of a mind on pursuing personal wealth in deals with the enemy rather than fighting it. The challenges facing the United States are vast and although there was not a superior or even a serious alternative to Trump and his alliance with the Silicon Valley oligarchs at the ballot box in 2024 it doesn't mean that it is going to be enough. Especially so if those individuals no longer believe in that republic anymore. There is an argument that the republic has already failed or is in the process of doing so. Hence when Peter Thiel's favorite court philosopher Curtis Yarvin argues for an American monarchy and to "end the democratic experiment" at a Yale University debate (October 2025) the audience isn't aghast like Benjamin Franklin and the Founding Fathers no doubt would have been. The America that emerges post Trump is not within Israel's control no matter what the anti Israel conspiracists like Fuentes claim. There is a tendency to be transfixed by the great American drama whether that be the January 6th Capitol riot in 2021, the failed Trump assassination attempts, the successful Charlie Kirk assassination attempt or the election of Islamic socialists like Zohran Mamdani to the position of New York City Mayor but none of this under Israel's control. Israel is under Israel's control assuming it enforces its sovereignty and independence. And it has a Jewish state if it can keep it.

If the focus is long term, post Trump and post Netanyahu, the future is undoubtedly as I stated earlier "the network(ed) state". On the demographic front white (nominally Christian) Europeans are surrendering nation state after nation state in Europe and state after state in the United States. Once surrendered and once the demographic tipping point has been reached the 19th century or 20th century peak version of that (nation) state is never returning. The math on white European birth rates versus non-white non-European birth rates is cruel and inexorable. I witnessed what a decade of a Sadiq Khan mayoralty did to London and you don't have to be a soothsayer to predict what a decade of Zohran Mamdani would do to New York City. Muslim populations concern me more than say Hindu or Buddhist populations for obvious reasons (terrorism, Sharia law, establishing aggressive Islamic caliphates, UK grooming gangs etc) but even more peaceful, more respectful, less aggressive populations change the character and values of a (nation) state. India or China, for all their strengths and weaknesses, are qualitatively and quantitatively different to 20th century America or 19th century Britain. Once a (nation) state is majority Indian or Chinese it will obviously increasingly resemble a Little India or Little China rather than a 20th century America or 19th century Britain. On the fiscal front a sustainable national debt path is being surrendered. As of October 2025 the United States national debt is 38 trillion dollars (125 percent of GDP) and inexorably rising. As I write this the federal government is shutdown, not because either side wants to reverse this fiscal trend but because one side wants to increase it faster than the other. Short of a great American rug pull redenominating the national debt in Bitcoin rather than the US dollar it is not a question of whether the United States will default or inflate its debt away, it is a question of when. So when the majority of the states in the United States are permanently non-white, non-Christian, non-European, left wing or socialist leaning and the federal government is paralyzed, dsyfunctional and essentially bankrupt what are the states (e.g. Florida, Texas) that still resemble success stories to do? Just like Israel in the Middle East they have to erect barriers to protect themselves from the regional majority and a federal government that will undoubtedly go back to a Democrat President at some point seeking the non-white, non-Christian, non-European vote. Just like Israel in the Middle East they have to control their immigration policy to ensure a future Democrat President opening the national borders to yet more third world immigration doesn't change the demographics of their states. Just like Israel in the Middle East they have to look for allies and trade relationships halfway around the globe rather than relying on the basket case neighbor state next door. Just like Israel in the Middle East they have to aggressively protect the identity, economic overperformance and fiscal position of their state even if it means national and global unpopularity, propaganda campaigns smearing their reputation and accusations of racist and religious superiority. Those states with significant Christian Zionist and Jewish populations will have a willing and enthusiastic ally waiting for them in the Middle East. This isn't the United States that the Founding Fathers sought or dreamed about but the numbers both demographically and fiscally are horrible and only going in one direction.

Israel's demographic and fiscal numbers aren't as concerning as the United States', as a small country without the world's reserve currency and without the precedent of being the 20th century's pre-eminent global superpower they simply can't afford to be. But if you scratch below the headline numbers there are certainly long term challenges if not reasons for concern. On the demographic front Israel is the outlier amongst the West in that it has a growing native (Jewish) population and doesn't need to prop up its GDP economic growth numbers and the projected solvency of its social security schemes by swelling its population with immigrants. Its birth rate was 2.9 children per woman in 2023 which compares to the United States' 1.62, the United Kingdom's 1.56 and the OECD average of 1.5, all below replacement rate. As discussed earlier this is primarily driven by the Haredi (or ultra-Orthodox) segment of the Jewish population which averages up to 7 children per woman and is projected to reach a third of the Israeli population by 2050. In an ideal world Israeli political discourse would be focused on the long term challenge the exponentially growing Haredi population presents. In the actual world the Trump, Netanyahu, American, Arab coalition ensures more pressing problems such as Gaza, Judea and Samaria are never resolved and so this particular issue repeatedly gets kicked into the long grass. Long term the Haredi population could make or break the Jewish state on a number of different axes. The obvious axis is defense. A small country with a population of approximately 10 million does not have a large pool of reservists to mobilize to begin with once you factor in age and to a more limited extent gender. If you grant exemptions to a third of the population (Haredis) and a fifth of the population (Arabs) that potential pool shrinks even further. The modern day nation state of Israel has been blessed by an era in which defense isn't purely a numbers game as technological superiority allows smaller militaries to fight off and in some cases defeat much larger ones. It has also been blessed by an era in which its much more populous Arab enemies haven't been aligned on military strategy and haven't capitalized during brief points in time when Israel's defenses were truly reeling such as at the beginning of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 or indeed in the days following the October 7th 2023 terrorist attacks. The typical Haredi perspective might be that Hashem will protect Israel if enough Haredis pray and that the human endeavor ensuring technological superiority and a competent, well organized fighting force is next to irrelevant. The Orthodox perspective, let alone the secular perspective, may take umbrage with this claim. However, the Haredi population not only presents a defense challenge it is also presents an economic one. After being on the absolute floor experiencing hyperinflation in the 1980s Israel's economy has grown to a GDP (gross domestic product) of approximately 540 billion USD in 2024 or half an Elon Musk assuming he becomes a trillionaire in the near future. (Let's leave for now the discussion of whether one man can credibly be considered twice as valuable as Israel's entire economy.) This is relatively healthy although when you look at GDP per capita (GDP divided by its population) it is less impressive. Israel had a GDP per capita of approximately 54,000 USD in 2024 which compares to the United States' 86,000 USD or Singapore's 91,000 USD. The United Kingdom had a similar GDP per capita as Israel at 53,000 USD. This essentially means that the United States and Singapore have almost double the average economic output per person when compared to Israel. Does this matter? Can the Holy Land or the global village's church/synagogue really be expected to compete economically with the United States and Singapore? Can you put a price on the societal contributions of spiritual leaders like "The Rebbe", "The Rambam" or Rabbi Meir Kahane? Perhaps not. But when the significant and growing Haredi population refuses to complete military service so they can contribute to Israel's defense, refuses to offer a (partially) secular education to their children so they can contribute to Israel's economy in the world of atoms or the world of bits and refuses to accept that millions of Haredi can't all be serving rabbis let alone reach the heights of a rare individual like "The Rebbe" you start to appreciate that below the headline birth rate numbers there isn't much to be optimistic about. You would much rather have an Haredi problem than an importing third world immigrants problem to inflate the population numbers. But it could increasingly be a millstone around Israel's neck nonetheless militarily and economically. In the worst case scenario of Haredi voters teaming up with Arab voters they could by 2050 have a majority to vote in a coalition that brings the entire state crashing down. Theodor Herzl, David Ben-Gurion and Ze'ev Jabotinsky brought into being a Jewish state but it is up to today's Jews to ensure they keep it.

"The Haredi world is right that Torah protects. Hazal (חז״ל), the sages, say Torah shields and saves. But the Torah never meant for prayer and learning to replace action. It meant for faith to guide action. When Amalek attacked, Joshua (יהושע) fought while Moses (משה) prayed. The Torah tells us that Israel prevailed only when Moses' hands were lifted towards heaven and Joshua's soldiers fought below. Neither faith alone nor action alone was enough. That's the model. Torah and defense. Heaven and earth. Body and soul. Each complementing the other. So yes, Torah protects the soldiers but the soldiers are also the way Hashem channels that protection into the world. Torah provides spiritual merit and the soldiers through their mesirut nefesh (מסירת נפש), through their sacrifice, their courage, they create their own immense merit too. Both are expressions of divine service. One through study and prayer, the other through sacrifice and action. Without Torah our defense lacks soul, without defenders our Torah lacks a vessel to live in. They are not rivals, they are partners. That is why gratitude must go both ways. No one in Jewish history has ever supported Torah study like the modern state of Israel. Tens of billions of shekels have gone into yeshivas, stipends, housing, food programs, child care. Maybe it wasn't always given enthusiastically. But if someone funds your institutions and protects your streets for decades reluctance doesn't erase generosity. And if we use the state's hospitals, roads and security we are stakeholders in that state whether we sing Hatikvah (Israeli national anthem) or not. The Torah commands hakarat hatov (הכרת הטוב, recognizing the good), gratitude, as a sacred duty. If Moses could show gratitude even to the Nile, how much more must we show gratitude to the people and structures that allow Torah to flourish in Israel today? And indeed that support has helped Torah flourish like never before. Think about it. Under Ottoman or British rule there were hardly any yeshivas and certainly not thriving in the way they are now. No safety for Jews to live in as they do today. Only when there was a Jewish state, defended by Jewish soldiers, could Torah return to Eretz Israel in such strength. For the first time in 2000 years Torah is being learned on a massive scale in the land of Israel. Because Jewish soldiers made it possible. The body protects the soul and the soul gives meaning to the body. Each exists for the other." Oliver Anisfeld, J-TV

There is an interesting parallel when you compare the split between Christian Zionists and the anti Israel contingent in the Republican Party in the United States and the split between the Orthodox and the Haredi in Israel over what the modern day nation state of Israel represents. To the Christian Zionists the return of Jews to the land of Israel is an exciting fulfillment of bibical prophecy and evidence that G\*d's original covenant with the Jewish people was never broken or replaced. Rather than threatening their Christian beliefs or bringing into question their own covenant with G\*d they perceive it as being strengthened when the "olive tree" they were grafted into to "share in the nourishing sap from the olive root" (Romans 11:17-18) is shown to be standing strong. They believe that branches were "broken off because of unbelief" but that those newly grafted in "do not support the root, but the root supports [them]". The Christians amongst the anti Israel contingent, obviously there are many secular and Muslim individuals within this contingent too, are broadly in the supersessionist camp. They believe that the covenant with the Jewish people was broken and replaced with a new covenant with the Christians, essentially that the "olive tree" was broken and fell and a new olive tree was grown in its place. Hence evidence that the original covenant with the Jewish people still stands and that there is a role in biblical prophecy for Jews that didn't convert to Christianity is deeply threatening to their religious doctrine. As former Fox News host Tucker Carlson stated in an interview with the Texas Senator Ted Cruz the modern day nation state of Israel is merely a "political entity", a secular state "run by Benjamin Netanyahu". What does this rupture in an American political party have to do with the split between the Orthodox and the Haredi within Israel itself? Just like the supersessionist Christians in America the Haredi are uncomfortable with what the modern day nation state of Israel represents. Whether it is because the Jewish Moshiach (Messiah) hasn't arrived yet, because the Zionists that formed the state like Herzl, Ben-Gurion and Jabotinsky were broadly secular, because the Declaration of Independence made no direct reference to Hashem or because cities like Tel Aviv are considered too secular the reverence they display for the Torah is not shared for the land and the modern day Jewish nation state that stands today on that land. The land that was justifiably fought over and defended in the Torah multiple times is, not yet at least, worth fighting for and defending in the present day. A Haredi Tucker Carlson is no doubt as I write this telling fellow Jews that the nation state in which they reside is a "political entity" and a secular state "run by Benjamin Netanyahu" and that they should fight to the death, not to defend it but to resist contributing to its defense. It is a rather sad, circular argument. Of course if the religious Jews perceive the modern day Jewish state as something unholy, not resembling the Israel of the Torah, not worth contributing to and defending and something foreign or alien to Hashem it will forever remain so. It can only be something holy, resembling the Israel of the Torah and worth contributing to and defending when you perceive it as such and decide to treat it as such. After all, the land is the same land as in the Torah (admittedly with smaller borders currently, regrettably), the people that inhabit the land are broadly distant descendants of the same people in the Torah, Hashem is the same Hashem as in the Torah and the (written) Torah hasn't changed since the times of the Torah. All the pieces are there. 

## 83 Super Sparta

"Israel is in a sort of isolation. We will increasingly need to adapt to an economy with autarkic characteristics, the word I most hate. I am a believer in the free market but we may find ourselves in a situation where our arms industries are blocked. We will need to develop arms industries here - not only research and development, but also the ability to produce what we need. We are Athens and Sparta. But we're going to be Athens and super-Sparta. There's no choice; in the coming years, at least, we will have to deal with these attempts to isolate us. What's worked until now will not work from now on." Benjamin Netanyahu (September 16th 2025)

It is rare in recent times to hear anything from Netanyahu's mouth that can't be imputed to either self-aggrandizement, public relations or dutifully carrying out the role of Trump stooge but to his credit the occasional smoke signal is emitted that suggests there is still a semblance of long term strategic thinking rather than an exclusive focus on political self-preservation. One example that went under the radar was his response to a journalist's question on what book he was currently reading, "A book by a historian, by the name of Barry Strauss. It's called The Jews [vs] Rome. Jews against Rome.... We lost that one. We have to win the next one." One example that very much detonated above the radar was his public declaration at a Ministry of Finance conference that due to defense and geopolitical realities Israel would need to become a "super-Sparta". The wailing and gnashing of teeth, inevitably from opposition politicians and hostile Israeli media but more disappointingly also from technology leaders and less hostile Israeli media, led to Netanyahu partially walking the statement back the next day. Avi Hasson, CEO of Startup Nation Central, the non-profit that recently released an exceptional report on "Israel in the Global Semiconductor Race" (more on that later) had responded "It's an unacceptable vision. No one is buying that [super-Sparta vision], as it's irrelevant for Israel. Israel is not a superpower like China or the US - our economy as a whole relies on raw materials, and certainly for our tech economy, global connectivity is like our oxygen." The major Tel Aviv Stock Exchange indices had also fallen between 1-2 percent in the immediate aftermath of Netanyahu's comments. With technological visionaries like these who needs Luddite lemmings?

Let's start with what Netanyahu clearly didn't mean when he referred to a 21st century (super) Sparta because unfortunately stating the obvious seems to be necessary. (I should perhaps be more charitable to Hasson and the like, Israelis have been under siege for two years both literally and figuratively and that isn't conducive to rational, long term thinking.) A 21st century Sparta, or indeed any nation state or superpower with adversaries, would not last very long if it refused to acquire the raw materials (e.g. aluminium, iron, copper, steel, lithium, titanium etc) it needed for defense or had zero leverage over global trade partners to acquire them. Netanyahu was not suggesting that Israel limit itself going forward to the raw materials that are present within its currently tiny borders. Nor was Netanyahu suggesting that Israel cut all the fiber optic submarine communications cables that connect it to the global internet and go back to purely paper based systems. Sparta was a leading military force over two millennia ago but would struggle to defend itself today against the tin-pot dictator of a failed state (UK? Jokes....) without access to modern day technology. So what events and forces led Netanyahu to summon the spirit of ancient Sparta? The dependence on the United States is repeatedly setting off alarm bells in the Israeli national security establishment. Whether it is President Biden or President Trump or numerous predecessors threatening arms embargoes it is clear that if Israel has any kind of aspiration to have the ability to complete critical military objectives rather than repeatedly leaving them unfulfilled it can't afford to continue to follow American orders ad infinitum. And yet whilst Israel is solely dependent on the United States for supplying missile interceptors and key components of its air defense systems it has to limit itself to muttering obscure ancient history references in public and humiliating apology calls to whoever recently provided President Trump with a free Boeing 747. Threatened arms embargoes from the Americans are nothing new but President Trump is managing to set off novel alarms that none of his predecessors managed. Selling F-35 stealth fighter jets to Saudi Arabia and potentially other Arab neighbors has the potential to erode Israel's air superiority in the region and pushes Israel to work on F-35 upgrades in secret without sharing them with the United States. Trump may be blinded by the dollar signs but to Israel their technological edge is a matter of life or death. On a long enough time frame America's pre-eminent superpower status is dependent on it too.

The major upside to Israel is that it is being forced, perhaps prematurely, to face and address issues that a multitude of nation states around the world will have to face themselves sooner or later. Whoever has the technological edge and whoever has already found answers to the questions that the 21st century poses will have more than enough leverage to obtain the raw materials it needs in trade negotiations. All the noise, all the social media propaganda, all the infiltration and delegitimization of global institutions like the United Nations, all the arrest warrants issued on trumped up charges of genocide, all of it fades into insignificance if another nation state looks at Israel and sees in it the difference between winning or losing their future war and the difference between being able to defend itself or not being able to defend itelf. But that aforementioned nation state will only look at Israel that way if it is credibly not a vassal state of the United States. If it is merely a vassal state of the United States then whatever technological edge or answers Israel can provide can be obtained by going through and dealing with the United States. Israel is obviously observing, monitoring and lobbying against American sales of the F-35 fighter jet to its Arab neighbors but is it the only nation or city state with an interest in maintaining an element of air superiority in its region? Of course not. For example, Singapore ordered four F-35Bs in 2020 for 2.75 billion USD and eight more F-35Bs in 2023 that are due to arrive in 2026-2028 (defensenews.com). It will no doubt be looking on with great interest at how the United States approaches sales in the Middle East and to what extent Israel is allowed to maintain air superiority by the Americans or how Israel is able to maintain air superiority despite the Americans.

Israel already has a jump-start on this particular problem. As early as 2010 Israel entered into negotiations with the United States for the purchase of F-35 fighter jets on the condition that it could make its own modifications and customizations to the aircraft. Although these initial changes were limited it ensured Israel became the first country and to this day only country (publicly at least) to be granted such permissions. Multiple iterations since, over more than a decade, have resulted in the F-35I or the "Adir" (אדיר, mighty one) with a unique information system, next generation electronic warfare, integration of Israeli weapon systems, external fuel tanks and the ability to carry weapons under its wings (Wall Street Journal). The United States reportedly still locks down the internal core system but Israel, with today's plug and play architecture, is able to add capabilities such as experimental precision missiles and command, control, communications and computing (C4) systems without waiting for American approval and going through Pentagon bureaucracy (Tactical Sky YouTube channel). Even in the highly unlikely case that Israel's Arabs neighbors managed to obtain the exact same state of the art aircraft as the Israelis, the F-35I say, there are still the matter of potential kill switches, access to software updates, maintenance challenges, pilot training and the need to acquire spare parts. But the air dominance Israel displayed during the Twelve Day War with Iran could, temporarily at least, be eroded with enemy aircraft able to detect Israeli fighter jets in the sky when their air defense system fails to trigger. A 21st century (super) Sparta, short of designing, sourcing the materials for and manufacturing a totally new fighter jet from scratch, controlling every aspect of the entire system, couldn't aspire to be much more Spartan.
