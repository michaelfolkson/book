In Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search For Meaning the preface describes the author-psychiatrist asking his patients “Why do you not commit suicide?”. It is a question I’ve struggled with for over a decade now even though I only recently opened this book. I still don’t have an answer. The best I can come up with is to not to disappoint G*d. But the world has been cripplingly disappointing to me from closest family and friends to my country to strangers I’ve asked the smallest favor from. Although the popular narrative is that slavery was ended and Jewish prisoners were freed from concentration camps it feels to me like neither has happened. It feels to me that slavery and concentration camps have just been expanded and franchised to include most of the world without people realizing. Arguably small pockets still exist where smart people are encouraged to be ambitious and work together to solve problems, create riches and that trite “change the world”. But even those pockets seem to end up being trashed or embroiled in wars after a period of time and I wasn’t able to gain long term access to those places regardless. If anything this state of affairs is even worse mentally and psychologically than the original. At least with slavery and concentration camps everyone could see with their own eyes where they were, could relate to each other and build relationships based on a shared reality. Imagine being in a concentration camp and trying to convince your fellow prisoner that they were even in a concentration camp in the first place. If they don’t ever venture to the mental walls of their cell the prospect seems farcical to them. 

The cruelty of prison guards can vary hugely from prison to prison. I think they are especially cruel in the UK. To start with UK citizens’ freedoms are curtailed to a much greater extent in comparison to say US citizens. There is only one game in town and that is the state. You are forced to rely on the state for everything from your physical protection to your health and a large part of the population also relies on the state for their livelihood. The state continues to demonstrate that it is either completely incompetent, malicious or both and nothing happens. Whether that be destroying the economy with years of Covid lockdowns, lying to its population that new vaccines don’t present risks or frightening its population that leaving a large bloc of nations (EU) was existential the state proves over and over and over again that it is totally useless. You would expect that most people who succeed in the state know this and they’ve long given up on any sense of patriotism or national service and they are purely there because it is the only way to enrich themselves.
