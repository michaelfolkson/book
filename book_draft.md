# Preface

I do not want to be writing this. There are a number of things I’d much rather be doing. The future (world of bits) will be built out somewhere whether it be the US, Israel or a collection of expat communities living a nomadic existence in the sun. It almost certainly won’t be the UK and hence writing this seems like a complete waste of my time. Why not just write it off as a (very large) sunk cost and focus on the future? But what person would I be if I left the equivalents of younger me to rot in the same (or worse) circumstances that I rotted in? I feel like I have a responsibility to those equivalents of younger me in a way that no one took responsibility for the prospects of actual younger me. Hopefully it will make a difference to someone. At the very least it will leave me with a clearer conscience.

## Why don't you commit suicide?

In Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search For Meaning the preface describes the author-psychiatrist asking his patients “Why do you not commit suicide?”. It is a question I’ve struggled with for over a decade now even though I only recently opened this book. I still don’t have an answer. The best I can come up with is to not to disappoint G*d. But the world has been cripplingly disappointing to me from closest family and friends to my country to strangers I’ve asked the smallest favor from. Although the popular narrative is that slavery was ended and Jewish prisoners were freed from concentration camps it feels to me like neither has happened. It feels to me that slavery and concentration camps have just been expanded and franchised to include most of the world without people realizing. Arguably small pockets still exist where smart people are encouraged to be ambitious and work together to solve problems, create riches and that trite “change the world”. But even those pockets seem to end up being trashed or embroiled in wars after a period of time and I wasn’t able to gain long term access to those places regardless. If anything this state of affairs is even worse mentally and psychologically than the original. At least with slavery and concentration camps everyone could see with their own eyes where they were, could relate to each other and build relationships based on a shared reality. Imagine being in a concentration camp and trying to convince your fellow prisoner that they were even in a concentration camp in the first place. If they don’t ever venture to the mental walls of their cell the prospect seems farcical to them. 

The cruelty of prison guards can vary hugely from prison to prison. I think they are especially cruel in the UK. To start with UK citizens’ freedoms are curtailed to a much greater extent in comparison to say US citizens. There is only one game in town and that is the state. You are forced to rely on the state for everything from your physical protection to your health and a large part of the population also relies on the state for their livelihood. The state continues to demonstrate that it is either completely incompetent, malicious or both and nothing happens. Whether that be destroying the economy with years of Covid lockdowns, lying to its population that new vaccines don’t present risks or frightening its population that leaving a large bloc of nations (EU) was existential the state proves over and over and over again that it is totally useless. You would expect that most people who succeed in the state know this and they’ve long given up on any sense of patriotism or national service and they are purely there because it is the only way to enrich themselves.

Assuming that the hypothesis is right and you’re in a prison without a specified term what should one do?  Try to make a rush for the escape? Buckle down and try to make the most of it? Try to chip away at your prison walls month by month Shawshank Redemption style? I’ve tried the first option. I’ve tried to get US citizenship and I’ve tried to get Israeli citizenship. Although theoretically nothing is impossible those prospects don’t seem promising currently without anyone in a position to provide assistance. Do I have any evidence to suggest the UK will change or provide more hope in the coming years? Absolutely zero. If anything I think it will get worse as it has decade on decade. Once the state objective becomes managed decline and clinging to the US to maintain relevance it becomes harder and harder to turn that oil tanker around. Although Brexit briefly provided a spark of hope and a potential launchpad to change direction that spark was very quickly snuffed out by the state, Covid and politicians who were more than happy to do the state’s bidding in gaslighting the UK population.

So that leaves the options of buckling down and chipping away at the walls. For me buckling down is sharpening the tools that should be valuable in an idealized world where you were allowed to use those tools. The digital world (the world of bits) is only two or three decades old which is absolutely nothing in comparison to the millennia of the world of atoms. Chipping away at the walls is this book. I may personally never escape but my attempts to chip away could lead to someone in the future continuing where I left off. When I look at a photo of me as a young boy I pity him for what he’s still got to go through. If there’s a similar young boy out there today with similar aspirations, similar intelligence and similar hope that he can make something of himself one day hopefully he can pick up the chipping where I left it and maybe even make it to the other end.

## UK royalty and the nepotism leakage

The UK media acts as if the royal family is paying them millions of dollars per day to ensure full page spreads like advertisers do. They will ask inane questions like “Is that the end for Meghan and Harry?” knowing full well that they will continue to cover their every movement, appearance and business venture ensuring that they continue to have relevance in the mindshare of their readers for the rest of their lifetimes. Why is the obvious question. An innocent capitalistic motivation would be that their readers have an unhealthy obsession with Meghan and Harry and they are merely serving up what their readers and customers want. An innocent patriotic like motivation would be that nothing else is happening in the country and the only thing that the UK has anymore that the rest of the world pays attention to is the royal family. Hence keep promoting the only asset the UK has in an attempt to attract eyeballs and attention overseas. Maybe there is some truth in those innocent explanations. But the more malign explanation is that the royal family is a critical piece of the state and the state wants to keep the population distracted with meaningless stories. The state doesn’t want the population to be informed, it doesn’t want the population focusing on their own lives and working hard to better their lives. It wants the population to stay captive to the state and with that objective the more helpless and the more useless the population becomes the better. Become 24/7 experts on the movements of Meghan and Harry and you are of no use to anyone other than as a brainwashed tool for the state.

I have always been split on UK royalty. In one sense it is a symbol of longevity and the merits of maintaining traditions and principles that prevented the turmoil and chaos that engulfed other nations when they threw out those traditions and principles. But in another sense it entrenches the nepotism and the quashing of ambition from the head of state down. If you could somehow maintain the symbol of longevity and tradition without it leaking into every facet of society and poisoning what theoretically should be a capitalistic, meritocratic and striving society it would be a net asset. But it leaks. The fawning over people who don’t seem to have any particular talents, insights or achievements other than they were born to the right people happens everywhere. Other than sport and until recently entertainment (both conveniently keeping the population on the sofa) which do at least show repeated examples of individuals rising from all walks of life to the top of their industries you’d be hard stretched to find an industry where who you were born to and who you know wasn’t a 100x predictor on future success over intelligence or innate ability. But who you know isn’t entirely determined by who you were born to, right? No it isn’t. But compare Individual X who went to the highest fee paying school to Individual Y who went to the local state school. Individual X not only meets other wealthy, influential people at home through dinner parties and such like, he is now meeting the only people who have a chance of being wealthy and influential in the future, the children of parents who are wealthy and influential. The only chance Individual Y gets of meeting the Individual Xs is at a top university where Individual Y somehow overcomes the odds of passing the admission tests without Individual X’s expensive tuition. Then enter the sense of superiority, the expensive wardrobe, the access to the most exclusive members clubs and the best Individual Y can hope for is to be kept around for the amusement. All this to meet individual Xs who may not have much intelligence or innate ability and probably aren’t motivated by anything because they have already have everything. So what was the point?

A reoccurring theme of this book will be what I wish I’d been told when I was young and what I wish didn’t take me two decades of my life to realize. The fact that it has taken me this long is a complete failure of my family, friendship groups, education system, national media, political system and indeed my country. Although I also have to take a large chunk of the responsibility the fact that no one in any facet of my life could point me in the right direction and that no one else was pursuing these same questions just shows how effective the state has been at ruthlessly sucking up any sense of ambition in anyone who wasn’t born into wealth and influence. 

## The star upon the hill

I definitely visited Israel later than I should have. When I try to dissect the reasons for only visiting in 2019 the UK media certainly played a large part. You’d struggle to find one TV program or one news report in the UK on the beauty and aspiration of the Israeli project. It was a never ending diet of terrorist attacks and military responses, supposedly warmongering Israeli leaders and innocent, helpless Arab victims in Gaza and the West Bank being unnecessarily carpet bombed. The worst perpetuator was the BBC, that supposed perfectly neutral paragon of virtue that I and everyone else in the UK is forced to fund under the threat of jail. It certainly seems that populations in Gaza and the West Bank have been radicalized against Israel and Jews generally but the BBC and other UK media outlets have done their best over the years to follow their example in the UK. When I see the anti Israel and anti Jewish sentiment in the UK in 2024 I see it is an inevitable consequence of the brainwashing from the BBC and other slightly less extreme UK media outlets that you could probably group as an entity within the UK “state”.

However I personally have to take a large part of the responsibility myself. Why didn’t I want to explore my Jewish identity on my father’s side? Why didn’t I think more about and study religion and religious texts more? When I repeatedly passed through these phases of hopelessness why didn’t I explore religion and the work of religious leaders? I don’t know. Neither of my parents were religious and being caught between two religions (in my case Judaism and Christianity) I ended up exploring neither. But that is on me. My upbringing and the tools of the state definitely played a part but I really should have been stronger and not been a victim to circumstance here.

Regardless of how long it took to me to get there my impressions of Israel shifted nearly 180 degrees on visiting. Is there a terrorist threat and military responses that result in death and injury that would sadden anyone with a heart? Undoubtedly. But to focus exclusively on that at the expense of the positive is like focusing entirely on G*d’s seeming indifference to suffering in the bible and ignoring the act of creation in the first place. The story of the Israeli nation state is a modern day miracle. Take one of the most heinous attempts to wipe out a race and a religion in human history (the Holocaust) and turn it into a rebuilding of the land of the Jewish people that they have yearned to return to for millennia. I will get into the Herzl vision, the military victories against the odds, the leaders who took Israel to a stronger position than the position they found it and the honing of the skills that will ensure Israel’s future but even ignoring all that. Is there anything that better embodies the human spirit than turning unbearable pain and suffering into something beautiful? A truly existential threat to the future of a race and a religion that wiped out a third of its global population and turning that into a beacon of hope? In the land of Abraham, Moses and Jesus? A mere mortal (or at least the vast majority of mere mortals) couldn’t imagine it.

## Dancing when others can’t hear the music

One of the most endearing details I read when first exploring Israel on a Birthright trip was accounts of Theodor Herzl traipsing round wealthy Jewish benefactors such as the Rothschild family effectively pitching for funding for a new Israeli nation state in the 19th century decades before it was formed and at a time when the prospect seemed farcical. For a nation state that over a century later would be labelled the “Startup Nation” for its incubation of disproportionately successful technology startups. Not only would Herzl not see that but he didn’t really see any fruits of his labor as he died in 1904 with the nation state of Israel only being formed in 1948. Now he has a Mount named after him in Jerusalem with his tomb at the top but during his lifetime he was undoubtedly dismissed as a crank rather than a visionary. Is that a happy or a sad tale for him personally? Depends on your priorities I guess. Would you rather live an affluent lifestyle and ensure your descendants live an affluent lifestyle or would you prefer to play a part in the history of your people regardless of whether you see any personal benefit in your lifetime? The vast majority would choose the former but that might change on their deathbed or on a meeting with their maker. David Goggins, the American retired Navy Seal and ultramarathon runner has talked in his books about the role that future meeting plays in motivating him. Can you do anything that brings you closer to G*d than attempting godlike feats down here on earth before your own light goes out? 

It sounds simple but it is anything but. Every single force especially in a country like a UK in 2024 is pulling you in the opposite direction towards mediocrity and being an obedient servant to the state. In times when the state is itself ambitious and competent, trying to manage a global empire or attempting to emerge victorious from a world war that might work well. But in times when the state stands for nothing other than managed decline and is determined to drag its citizens into the abyss with it there is nothing worse. You can’t overthrow it, it is becoming harder and harder over time to exit and if you fail to exit it will drag you and your descendants into a state of permanent poverty and hopelessness.

At this point I’m not sure why nearly every Jew in the UK and other countries around the world doesn’t have a passport to the only Jewish nation state on the planet even if it is held merely as a hedge against future waves of antisemitism in their home country. You only have to have a basic grasp of history to understand that domestic economic troubles or international military conflicts often drive these waves of antisemitism as the state looks for individuals or groups of individuals to pass the blame to. In addition in the UK there has been a large influx of Arab, Muslim immigrants (both legal and illegal) that threatens to change societal and political dynamics and hence the potential safety of Jews in the UK for generations. Perhaps others will encounter what I did where UK rabbis block UK citizens from using Israel’s The Law of Return’s grandparent clause to obtain an Israeli passport. But not trying seems neglectful to me. UK rabbis will have to ultimately answer to their maker on why they are choosing to block those attempts with UK safety concerns rising but it is otherwise hard to speculate on their reasons for doing so.

## Finding your community

But let’s say your ethnicity or religion doesn’t entitle you to a different passport (or people block you from a passport you are entitled to). What do you do if your home state’s objectives aren’t aligned with your personal goals and ambitions and actively works against you from attempting them? I’ll assume here that you don’t have the privilege of a US passport as that would allow you to move from state to state in the US. The first step is to find your community online and then work out where they are geographically located. Whoever you are, whether you are Theodor Herzl or David Goggins you need to find people who share similar interests, are better than you at certain skills and will test your ideas. Although ultimately Herzl and Goggins settled into a more lonely experience pursuing their goals the road to success was littered with interactions with individuals who were smarter, more able, more informed and more effective at the time of those interactions. It is self defeating trying to achieve a goal in a vacuum when there are people who are better than you already working on similar goals. Get to know who those people are first. Until you understand your community, understand what it is missing and start to get frustrated by their standards or lack of their ambition it is too early to cut yourself off. 

The world is a big place and although escape routes are being closed off all the time there are still expat communities in places like Central and South America and Asia which have relaxed entry and visa requirements, are relatively cheap to live in and have good internet access. Your community probably already has a presence in some of these places but even if it doesn’t it is only a matter of time before your community starts to gravitate to places where they can meet and collaborate in person. Be the first and encourage other members of your community to join you.

## Meritocracy versus “diversity”

At least in the West in 2024 “diversity” has triumphed over meritocracy. “Diversity” has been twisted into a painting by numbers “Let’s have one black girl, one brown homosexual, one Asian transexual”. That is not meritocracy and it isn’t even getting the fruits of diversity. A meritocracy measures the output and attempts to maximize that output. A healthy diverse meritocracy doesn’t care about superficialities like color of skin, gender or sexuality. It is chasing ambitious goals that needs the smartest and the hardest working and it can’t afford to make compromises to meet the painting by numbers requirements. The ticket to the game is competence, ambition and aspiration to continuously improve. If someone has a ticket to the game then different perspectives can be a net positive especially if it is challenging and testing each other’s viewpoints. But it is the output that matters. The obsession with superficial inputs is driving the West into the ground. As always it is hard to tell what is driving the “diversity” movement in the West. Is it incompetent or malicious forces within the state? Is it external forces from outside the state that are determined to cause the West’s demise? I don’t know. But if you are in an environment which cares more about the color of your skin, gender and sexuality over your potential and your work ethic you need to escape from that environment as quickly as possible. We often see our organisation or our country as the entire world but it is only a tiny part. When you start to see things that set your personal alarms off you really need to ask yourself “Am I ok with this? Does this align with the principles I want to live my life by? Can I thrive in this environment?” Because if the answer is no you need to get out of there yesterday.

Israel is not a perfect place, no such place exists. But somehow despite it feeling like a country in the collective West it is managing to not succumb to the “diversity” narrative rotting away at the West’s previous exceptionalism. Yet on actual diversity metrics it seems to be performing exceptionally well. It had one of the earliest female Prime Ministers (1969-1974) in Golda Meir predating the UK’s Margaret Thatcher by a decade. Both genders are expected to complete military service before their university studies and serve their country when required. Despite having the Jewish religion as a centerpiece for the state there are parts of Israel such as Tel Aviv which are typically atheist or agnostic where Gay Pride Week is celebrated. It also maintains an Arab population of approximately 20 percent despite being accused of seeking religious and ethnic purity by its detractors. On actual diversity metrics it is certainly a shining light in the Middle East and one could argue in the collective West as well despite the West’s obsession with “diversity”. How has it managed this? I believe it is because the Israeli state has a purpose and can’t afford to allow the meritocracy to decay. It has military threats on its borders and sometimes within its borders. Without access to natural resources or a historic role in global trade or finance it has to capitalize on new opportunities, new technologies and the new frontier that has opened up in the world of bits. Necessity is the mother of invention and a bulwark against the rot setting in in the West. Do I think the West and specifically the US is a lost cause on the road to inevitable decline? No. But the further it falls away from the example being set in Israel and the longer it goes without a severe course correction the more inevitable that decline becomes. I have been flabbergasted by Western leaders lecturing Israel on military matters as they preside over their own country sliding into decay, incompetence and increasing irrelevance. The saying "Clean your home first before complaining about others" comes to mind.

What I suspect has also happened is the world has bifurcated into the global majority penned in by nation state boundaries and the global super rich who consider the nation state, passports, patriotism, taxes and public services as cute anachronisms from a bygone era. They are still utilized as tools to keep the global majority in their pens but they impose zero constraints or assumed responsibilities on the super rich. The more dysfunctional you can make the management of those pens the more noise there is to distract the global majority from the realization that they are second class citizens and the laws that apply to them don’t apply to the global super rich. Under this hypothesis narratives like “diversity”, the normalisation of gender transition and climate change where the global majority are told to worry about cows farting as the super rich’s private planes fly over that cow start to make sense. The super rich aren’t stupid enough to actually believe these narratives but they are used to spread discord in the pens and prevent sane, smart people from arriving at the truth. Political leaders are more than happy to do the super rich’s bidding because it either provides them entertainment or an ego boost if they are already part of the super rich and if they aren’t it offers them a route to make it there when no such other route exists. As a nation state Israel is not immune to these forces but it is well placed to suffer the least. If there is a nation state that the super rich care about (or specifically the subset of the super rich that is religious Jewish) it is Israel. It is part of the Jewish identity being the only Jewish state and although Christians or Muslims may have an affinity to a particular nation state there are a large number to choose from. If one descends into poverty and chaos they can just spend more time in a different one.

This hints at the specific moral challenge I and presumably others not born into the super rich have or will have. If you have grown up in a nation state and bought into values that the super rich don’t hold what do you do? Do you shed them and do everything in your power to escape from your pen perhaps finding some way to cling onto the super rich if that is the only escape route? Or do you hold onto those values knowing this risks being trapped inside and being subject to increasing levels of chaos and poverty? Both seem unsatisfactory to me and hence a dual strategy seems the only way forward. You have to hedge the fact that the super rich could decide to make the nation state you grew up in temporarily or permanently unliveable. You can’t afford to have all your chips on a dysfunctional political system that may never reverse the decline. You must have an alternative that will allow you to continue to grow, improve and sharpen your skills even as your nation state languishes. But at the same time your ancestors fought and risked their lives for their country and what it stood for in the past. They believed in a national project, they built the infrastructure, they grew the economy to one of the strongest economies in the world. Are you ready to write off that effort in the pursuit of freedom from the pen?

I subscribe to the Jordan Peterson “make your bed first” or get your life in order first before you worry about other people’s lives: living or dead. If you can’t succeed within a system because of an incompetent and/or malicious state then you have to leave. If you succeed elsewhere you can always come back later from a position of a strength with funds to deploy rather than as a helpless, powerless and moneyless victim. But if it is a battle between a well meaning individual with a single vote at the ballot box and an overly expanded state led by puppets installed by the global super rich there is only going to be one winner.

## Politics, spin and the “progression” from Sir Humphrey to Malcolm Tucker

I hate politics. As the former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said "Politics divides, science unites". Generally politics is a grubby pursuit of power filled with people who couldn't have succeeded with their limited skillsets in the marketplace. There are occasional political leaders who enter the dirty game with principles, stick to them under unbearable pressure from every possible side, both internally and externally, and manage to pull their country out of decline or set it on a course that wouldn’t have been possible without that individual’s efforts. In the UK the obvious examples from the last century are Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. One led their country to victory in World War 2 leaning heavily on the US and the other inherited a basket case of an economy with widespread strikes, a three day working week, recession and high inflation and managed to turn it around. However they are the exception rather than the rule. Certainly since Thatcher resigned in 1990 and for the three decades since civil servants such as Sir Humphrey (characterised in the UK TV show Yes, Minister) and spin doctors such as Malcolm Tucker (characterised in the UK TV show The Thick of It) have been in the ascendancy. Whether it is civil servants preventing elected politicians from implementing the policies they were elected on or spin doctors obsessively focusing on image and PR at the expense of all else the principles and resilience Churchill and Thatcher demonstrated became yet another quaint anachronism from a bygone era. David Cameron (UK Prime Minister, 2010-2016) was essentially a trained spin doctor himself. You have to look internationally for more recent examples of political leaders who made a Churchill or Thatcher level impact on their countries. An impact where you can confidently say if you switched them out for someone else history would have been very different. The obvious example is the current Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Although I’m much less familiar with Asian politics Lee Kuan Yew seems to have been long term transformative for Singapore. Then you’ve got President Trump and the El Salvador President Nayib Bukele who show promise to be elevated to this level but are definitely in the job half finished category in 2024. As the UK dishes out titles, lordships and decorations to mediocre, meaningless British leaders here in the UK you have to scour the world to find the people who have actually picked their country up and transformed it through their own individual will and a competent background staff. 

So let’s say you want to be your country’s Netanyahu or Thatcher. You don’t want to be just another name on a long list of people who managed to climb to the top of the greasy pole. You want to be able to point to where your country was when you came into power and show how your insights, your intelligence, your foresight, your resilience and your unwavering principles took it to a place that no other living human in your country could have done. Where do you start? Well first of all the vast majority of people aren’t capable. Just like sport where Roger Federer, Tiger Woods, Usain Bolt, Serena Williams etc are genetic freaks of nature I think the vast majority of people aren’t capable of being Netanyahu or Thatcher. I’m less familiar with Thatcher’s life story and what made her into the “lady not for turning”, a lady capable of crawling out of an IRA bombing of a Brighton hotel and continuing on exactly the same course. As a rare female example on this short list I think she was what David Goggins would call “an uncommon amongst the uncommon”. Most parents would not want to put their sons through the crucible that Thatcher went through let alone their daughters and that makes her even more of a freak. But because I’ve read more on Netanyahu in recent years let’s focus on him.

## Israel’s most challenging century - its first

A human or any animal’s most vulnerable moments are in the early years. They don’t have the knowledge, experience or ability to fend for themselves. They don’t know the threats they should worry about, the supposed threats they don’t need to worry about and even if they did they don’t know how to effectively protect themselves from them. Certainly in the animal world it is these early years where they are most likely to fall from a tree or be torn apart by a predator. The dependence on the parents is maximized and it gradually loosens over time. Israel as a nation state didn’t really have parents. You could argue the UK was a parent controlling the land pre the formation of the Israeli nation state and issuing the Balfour declaration in 1917. In its early years as a nation state Israel obtained most of its military and financial support from France with the US initially disinterested but over the decades Israel came to rely on the US as the primary provider of military and financial support. Today you’d probably say the US is in the parental role with perhaps the UK and France in a grandparent role. But in the early years presumably the US thought it wasn’t going to survive and it wasn’t worth investing in. Nonetheless the Israeli nation state was born into a sliver of land surrounded by predators: Arab, Muslim majority countries that didn’t want it to exist and were determined to destroy the concept of a Jewish nation state in the Middle East before it gained any legitimacy. Although Herzl and others had worked on the vision in the previous decades the vision meant nothing if it was going to be destroyed by predators post conception. Hence the country Netanyahu was born into was a country housing a people still devastated by the Holocaust, with no clear parental protectors and threats wherever the eye could see. The number one priority was and even today still is defense. Put Netanyahu in a room with an Eton educated, trained spin doctor with no military experience like Cameron and he inevitably seems cold, stubborn, unreasonable and unrelenting. One has dedicated their life to the sole purpose of ensuring a viable long term future for their nation state and the other has spent their life thinking how they can change the public perception, not the stone cold reality, of a political party in peacetime. If I was Netanyahu I'd be staggered by the arrogance that a Cameron had anything to contribute to long term Israeli military strategy discussions but I digress.

The narrative during Netanyahu’s lifetime, even from many US Presidents in the supposedly parental role, is that Israel should agree to split its sliver of land in the Middle East and its capital city in half and allocate it to a nation state for Arab Muslims in a region of the world where there is nothing other than nation states for Arab Muslims. Indeed within Israel itself 20 percent of the population is Arab, presumably majority Muslim. What they’ve asked Netanyahu to do is effectively split the equivalent of London or Washington DC into two halves: one half in which they control and another half in which the historic predators control. Please note I am not accusing all Arab Muslims of being predators. Many of them live peacefully within Israeli borders and don’t present a terrorism risk. But the prospect of asking the UK or US government to do that for their capital cities is beyond absurd. So Netanyahu has spent his whole life in this dance with the parental figure who just won’t let go of this “solution” that will achieve nothing other than ensuring Israel never emerges from the waves of terrorism and internal violence in the periods it isn’t additionally fighting predators outside of its borders. So want to be your country’s Netanyahu? Try standing up for your nation state’s long term viability against the world’s greatest military power without being toppled by the CIA and without offending them to the extent that they withdraw military and financial support. That’ll test whether you are truly “not for turning”.

Let’s turn to the economy. Because unless you are going to be funded perpetually by the parental figure you have to find a way to fund your nation state’s defense yourself. Especially if you aren’t going to compromise on the long term viability of your nation state amongst disagreements with that same parental figure. In the 1980s Israel experienced hyperinflation with the inflation rate reaching as high as 450 percent. Although socialism had succeeded in building a base layer infrastructure for this still nascent nation state as many other nation states have found to their cost socialist, centrally managed economies don’t scale. Control of industries has to be wrestled from the state and exposed to competition and market forces. A now thirty something Netanyahu was surveying a nation state not much older than him with a basket case economy and what seemed like total economic dependence on the parental figure. All while dealing with the death of his brother attempting to save Israeli hostages from Entebbe in Uganda years previous. So how are you doing aspiring Netanyahu? Able to move on after the death of your brother? Still have hope for your nation state as its economy languishes in the dustbin? After years of military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with expertise in defense rather than economic matters feel up to the challenge of turning around your nation state’s economy?

The playbook for turning a socialist, state controlled economy into a capitalist market based economy is not rocket science at least today in 2024. It has happened so many times now in economies all over the world that at least the broad strokes are just following the same weathered recipe. Indeed the economic reforms carried out in the 1980s in the UK by Thatcher and Nigel Lawson had a number of parallels with the reforms implemented by Shimon Peres and Netanyahu in Israel. Identify inefficient bureaucratic state monopolies, break them apart and allow the resulting businesses to compete for customers and engage in price competition. Of course it is hideously difficult to do in practice because yet again you find yourself surrounded by swarms of predators who are determined to prevent it from happening. Whether it is bureaucrats heading up those state monopolies, criminals who are profiting from the state monopolies’ excesses, misguided left wing politicians who are convinced socialism will eventually work, the media screaming that you will destroy what's left of the economy or employees who are frightened by the prospect of having to retrain and find a new role, the battle to force through obvious reforms is intense. Your life may not be at risk in the same way it is in military operations but it certainly requires similar levels of determination and refusal to quit or compromise. What I find incredible about Peres and Netanyahu is that not only did they succeed in this socialism to capitalism transformation but they also foresaw the technological trends that would present Israel with its best opportunity to fund its defense and gradually wean itself of its dependence on the US. Peres foresaw the “computer tak(ing) the place of the sword” even if the world of atoms can never be entirely ignored and Netanyahu returned from his studies at MIT in the 1970s convinced that Israel needed its own version of Silicon Valley with military intelligence, academia and business collaborating to launch “a thousand technological ships”. Liberating currency controls and freeing monetary transactions from the central bank (Bank of Israel) was one thing but foreseeing the impact computers and the internet would have in the 1970s (before I was even born) I find astonishing. As a teenager 30 years later, admittedly in a country with a dearth of technological ambition and a brain drain to the US, it wasn’t at all clear to me that technology or software would "eat the world" in the way it has.

Warren Buffett has talked about the “ovarian lottery” which decides your race, gender, wealth, genetic intelligence, health, geography etc at birth. If you wanted to succeed in the technological boom of the 2000s and 2010s you really needed access to the US and Silicon Valley. It is almost certain in my eyes that we would have never heard of Peter Thiel, Elon Musk or Sergey Brin if they hadn’t managed to emigrate to the US. But if you couldn’t make it to the US during these decades Israel would have been your next best bet. Although it doesn’t boast the same household names, brands or company valuations as Silicon Valley the foresight of Peres and Netanyahu laid the groundwork for the “Startup Nation” and the most tech startups and largest venture capital industry per capita on the planet. Mobileye, Check Point, Monday, Wix are all Israeli technology companies worth billions of dollars today and that doesn’t include all the acquisition successes such as Waze, Chromatis and NDS also valued in the billions of dollars. For an economy collapsing under hyperinflation in the 1980s it is quite the achievement that people were writing books on how other countries should be copying Israel 30 years later. Not bad for a guy discharged from the military after being shot in the shoulder and still grieving his deceased brother.

## Enter Bitcoin

I got more and more interested in Bitcoin around 2014. At that point one Bitcoin was worth approximately $200. As I write this in 2024 one Bitcoin is worth over $50,000. It has gone up by a multiple of 250. So I and many other UK citizens are now very wealthy and there is a thriving UK industry built around this new asset class valued approximately a trillion dollars? No. Well there must be a real momentum to correct that in 2024? Isn’t London supposed to be up there with New York as one of the world’s pre-eminent financial centers? Also no. What instead has happened in that decade is the UK media has covered it almost exclusively as a Ponzi scheme, a bubble, something that only criminals and money launderers ars interested in in a negative media blitz that is only comparable to its coverage of Israel during my lifetime. The UK regulator has done everything in its power to squash Bitcoin startups and Bitcoin business models including recently requiring Bitcoin exchanges to refuse to provide services to individuals who had purchased too much Bitcoin in the past and weren’t classed as high net worth individuals. The UK government has declared its intention to make the UK a “global crypto asset technology hub” all while UK banks increasingly prevent their customers from using their own funds to purchase Bitcoin. Yet another example of gaslighting from the UK state where they declare something in public whilst trying to achieve the polar opposite in private. And not only that. But during the previous decade due to the lasting effects of the 2008 financial crash, the inability to grow the UK economy and more recently the years of Covid lockdowns the Bank of England (the UK central bank with convenient regulatory powers too) has engaged in large scale money printing (“quantitative easing”) pumping up the prices of conventional asset classes, reducing the real value of cash, forcing companies into shrinking their products (“shrinkflation”) to disguise the effects of the increase in the money supply and then last year the dam burst and even official consumer price inflation rocketed. The average house price in the UK has doubled from 2009 to 2024 (statista.com) and in some cities like London that multiple was greater than 2. Unless you've managed to get a 100 percent investment return in that time you have become poorer indexed by a (real) asset that follows the monetary supply like property. If your wages have doubled in that time you are still being paid the same salary you were in 2009 in real terms adjusted by the property index. No mainstream media channel will tell you this. Why? Because the state doesn't want you to know and the media is effectively a state media. In contrast Bitcoin has a fixed monetary supply, still has large price upside and has now survived and become more and more valuable for 16 years. This is what convinces me that the UK state wants its citizens to remain poor and if anything continue to get poorer. Imagine working hard your entire life and paying your taxes to a sprawling state that doesn’t want you to succeed, doesn’t want you to become wealthy and will actively work to keep you poor. Is that what UK citizens’ ancestors fought for in World War 1 and World War 2? To be lied to, misinformed, gaslighted and ultimately prevented from becoming wealthier by the very entity their ancestors fought for and risked their lives for decades previous? It is hideous and those ancestors must be turning in their graves.

Now Bitcoin could fail. There is a history of national currencies experiencing hyperinflation, cutting some zeros off and starting again. Indeed Israel today is using the “new Shekel” rather than the “old Shekel” for this very reason. In currency or asset terms Bitcoin is that parentless baby surrounded by predators wherever the eye can see. There are a number of questions long term about what function Bitcoin will perform globally. Will it be a new global monetary unit of account, can it scale so that it can be used as a daily medium of exchange or is it digital gold for a new gold standard? Will the 21st century central bank issue national currency linked to the Bitcoin it holds in the same way as the 19th century central bank issued currency linked to the gold it holds? Or will the central banks just cut the zeros off their national currency and all the people whose savings were inflated away over previous decades forgive and forget? I don’t know. But what I do know is over the previous decade all branches of the UK state have done everything in their power to suppress Bitcoin, suffocate Bitcoin startups at birth and brainwash its citizens to associate it with crime and fraud. Just as the UK media has portrayed Israel as a nation state with no redeeming features other than terrorism and military responses the media has put the fraudsters, the Ponzi schemes that latch onto Bitcoin and the venture capitalists promoting alternatives to Bitcoin whilst privately buying Bitcoin themselves on the pedestal and broadcasting their messages out far and wide. Nothing on the potential merits of Bitcoin, nothing on its fixed monetary supply versus the seemingly unlimited quantitative easing (printing money) the central banks are carrying out in the shadows and nothing on some of the smartest developers and technologists globally being attracted to Bitcoin as arguably their generation’s greatest opportunity to make the historic impact and the wealth that the previous wave of internet entrepreneurs (Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin etc) made. Peter Thiel's and Elon Musk's PayPal initially set out to build a global digital currency and ultimately failed. Bitcoin could "fail" too, it could fade into irrelevance just as people were writing off the internet at the turn of the millennia. But for the UK state to prevent their citizens from making that choice to participate in it, to prevent their citizens from potentially making money from it and to try to prevent digital Bitcoin from moving between citizens in the same way as laptops obtain search query bits from Google is the height of arrogance and sinister incompetence. UK citizens are not free, the UK state knows what’s best for you and all those times in the past the UK state lied to you or was wrong about important issues? Well you can’t remember them goldfish brain can you? Here’s what Meghan and Harry are up to today.

## The method behind the madness - how to make a country great again

When a country has sunk into the abyss for decades, every branch of the state seems to be compromised by forces that solely want to keep the majority in their pens and everyone seems to be indifferent to their fate is it over? Do you write that country off as a failed project? Is it impossible to turn it around? Well probabilistically nothing is impossible but if you compare the challenge to say the challenge Trump has faced in making America great again, the UK has been and still is in much worse shape. It wasn’t too long ago that Wall Street, Washington DC, Silicon Valley, Hollywood etc were the envy of the world. What exactly has the world been envious of in the UK in recent decades? This is not to denigrate the challenge that Trump faced and still faces in 2024 but for the UK to attempt something similar you’d need a Trump on steroids. Someone who could pick up the Trump playbook and somehow take it to even further extremes. So I guess the first step is to understand the Trump playbook. Friedrich Nietzsche, the 19th century German philosopher stated “All great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity”. The first phase of Trump’s reincarnation as a political leader back in 2015 rather than a business mogul and TV personality was to shock and seize attention of the airwaves. This was a step change from the personality he displayed previously. In his many TV appearances over the decades he is passionate, driven and certainly a committed capitalist but he is greeted warmly by TV hosts and TV audiences on all sides of the political spectrum. In 2015 that changed. Whether it be Mexican immigrants are “bringing crime, they’re rapists and some I assume are good people”, TV networks that he’d previously regularly appeared on were an “enemy of the people” or “I think Islam hates us” he deliberately courted controversy with messaging which dressed up his legitimate concerns on immigration, the TV networks being dragged leftwards under Obama and the continued terrorism threat from Islamist extremists into soundbites designed to shock. This was very different to the typical politician. Firstly the typical politician doesn’t seem to have any principles or deeply held beliefs, they will say what they need to say to get elected and to keep their donors happy. But secondly they will also communicate in a way designed to upset as few potential voters as possible so as not to harm their election prospects. Trump wasn’t getting into politics to add his name to the list of US Presidents. He was getting into politics to make America great again after a lifetime of frustration with the American political system. This all cumulated obviously in January 6th where Trump was willing to go right up to the line with his justified anger over censorship and lack of controls around widespread postal voting but critically without crossing it. In a nation with the world’s strongest military and intelligence agencies such as the CIA and NSA and after four years of being embroiled in impeachments and investigations from everything to Russia collusion to financial fraud to sex scandals crossing that line could have been fatal. A UK based Trump would probably have been put in jail for hate speech years previous for “I think Islam hates us”.

## The first term - dismantling the state

Imagine you are an Allied soldier liberating prisoners from a Nazi concentration camp or an Israeli soldier attempting to free an Israeli hostage from an underground network of tunnels in Gaza. You are surveying a complex structure that was built for a purpose: in the former to exterminate the Jews and in the latter to undermine and ultimately destroy the nation state of Israel. If you don’t have the same goals as those who built those structures in the first place you have to effectively decide whether you can repurpose those structures for a different goal and if not destroy them to make space for something new. The first term of the Trump Presidency was utterly bewildering. You had individuals who had no qualifications and no business being near the machinery of government being hired and fired within weeks and sometimes days. What was the “stable genius” doing? Well if you are going to do some destroying you are going to need to engage in some distraction tactics. The left in America has produced some incredible inspiring and eloquent speakers from John F Kennedy to Barack Obama but you’d struggle to outline their political achievements in office and you’d also struggle to argue that they really changed the trajectory of their country. The focus was on words rather than actions. Meanwhile to the intellectual, ivory tower classes Trump, Bush Jr and maybe even Reagan seem like idiots. The media and political circus never stops and so if you are actually going to succeed in taking a sledge hammer to complex structures that aren’t required anymore and perhaps never were you need them focused in the opposite direction being driven into a frenzy because a supposed moron was elected President or there is a revolving door of crazy White House appointments. The media relations with the JFKs and the Obamas were a love-in. Meanwhile the media generally demonizes those on the right and so you need someone or something to absorb that hate. If Trump is reelected in 2024 the focus will almost certainly be on the rebuilding of America now that some of those complex structures have been destroyed or at least been shown up to be acting in the opposite interests of its people. No doubt Trump will still seek to shock occasionally but the first phase is complete. The next phase post demolition is to rebuild.

## The supposedly perfectly neutral paragon of virtue that is the BBC

If you watch television in the UK you are forced to pay the TV license fee under the threat of fines and ultimately jail. It doesn’t matter if you never watch anything on the BBC and watch other channels exclusively you still must pay the TV license fee. The license fee goes predominantly to the BBC. This puts the BBC in an incredibly powerful position. Firstly it is “free” to view in the same way as other state services are supposedly “free”. They’re obviously not free, they are taxpayer funded but in the world of socialism you pay your taxes, ignore how they’re being spent and then marvel that you’re lucky enough to live in a country that dishes out free stuff. As it is “free” to view, doesn’t require optional subscription fees to be paid or ads to be viewed the less affluent gravitate towards the BBC for entertainment and more crucially news. The justification for the BBC being funded by its citizens under the threat of jail is that the BBC is politically neutral, impartial and balanced. We’ll explore some of the examples where the BBC has failed hideously in its supposed objective but G*d himself would be unable to fulfil this objective. In a world of 8 billion people and let’s say 24 hours of daily news coverage every decision to try to stay politically neutral, impartial and balanced is impossible. Let’s say there is a terrorist attack in Israel and Sierra Leone at a similar time. Which do you shine a light on by covering it? Who do you interview? What are their political biases? How much time do you spend covering it? Should you cover either at all when there are 70 million people in your home country who have their own challenges. Every minute there are crimes being committed in your home country from rape to murder to sexual abuse of minors to burglaries. You have one light and only 24 hours to shine it. What is the politically neutral, impartial and balanced way to shine it? It is an impossible question to answer.

What the BBC has settled on in recent years and in many cases much longer than that is a stance that is anti Brexit, anti Israel, anti capitalism, anti conservatism, anti religion, ignores atrocities in parts of the world that don’t matter (Africa, Asia etc), ignores scandals that occur within BBC walls such as the child sexual abuse of “Sir” Jimmy Savile (yes he was awarded a Knight Bachelor and Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire which I’m sure his victims appreciated at the time) and instead buys totally into the concern with cows farting and the “diversity” agenda. If you don’t want to fund this agenda, tough. It will be prison for you comrade. Why the supposed right wing, nominally the Conservative Party, in the UK puts up with this is a total mystery. No matter what the BBC does the government at the time, right wing or left wing, renews the Royal Charter without fail ensuring citizens can’t watch television without funding the BBC. With the power to decide what is politically neutral, impartial and balanced the BBC can essentially decide what the center ground of a spectrum is. If the center ground is anti Israel for example then it provides a space which can freely support terrorism and the attempted destruction of Israel because that is a valid “left of center” position. Anyone who is pro Israel isn’t on the center, they aren’t even on the right, they are on the supposed far right. If the BBC’s defined center ground cares more about “diversity” than child sex rings committed by predominantly Muslim immigrants in the north of England then someone who cares about those child sex rings (e.g. Tommy Robinson) isn’t on the right, they are on the supposed far right. The BBC decides where the center ground is and who should be ignored and censored as far right and who should be given a platform on a mainstream news channel despite hideous anti white, anti male, anti working class, anti Jewish and anti Israel hatred. As I write this (March 2024) the BBC has been exposed yet again for a sympathetic documentary on refugees that showcased individuals (Omar and Mohamed Badreddin) who were later found guilty of torturing and raping a 13 year old girl. Not only that but the BBC aired accusations that the 13 year old girl was racist and had made up the rape accusation. The spirit of "Sir" Jimmy Savile lives on at the BBC. Harbor and protect child abusers and if anyone complains accuse them of being "far right" and/or racist. This is the BBC's center ground. 

Isn’t the BBC regulated? If UK citizens are forced to fund it and it is able to define the center ground of political discourse in the country then surely the regulator must be all over them compared to competing news channels that aren’t in this privileged position. Well there is a regulator “Ofcom” or the “Office of Communications” which obviously is also taxpayer funded and yet another branch of the state that is essentially regulating itself in this case if you consider the BBC a different branch of the state. But instead of being all over the BBC in recent times it has instead turned most of its attention and resources on startup news channels like GB News and TalkTV. Startup news channels that aren’t taxpayer funded, don’t have powers to throw citizens in jail and have no authority to define the center ground or define the spectrum of an issue. These businesses have to find ways to fund themselves with advertising or subscriptions and viewers have to consciously seek them out being tucked away on a previously unused TV channel number, a website or a YouTube channel. So why has Ofcom prioritized cracking down on these startup news channels and given the BBC an effective free pass? We know the answer (state good, competition bad) but what is Ofcom’s justification? Well they aren’t sufficiently impartial of course! The BBC succeeds in being impartial (of course!) with occasional slip ups but these alternative news channels don’t sit neatly on the spectrum that the BBC essentially defines. Individuals who are ignored, censored or dismissed as “far right” on the BBC are sometimes given a platform on these news channels which is unacceptable. Right wing politicians who wouldn’t be given much if any time to express their views on the BBC are given ample time to express their views on these alternatives. And sometimes, and this really is horrific, they have discussions or debates between individuals who are all to the right of the center of the BBC’s spectrum. Without one individual to the left of the center of the BBC’s spectrum. No Israel haters, no individuals preaching the gospel of the scourge of cows farting or the heavenly delights of “diversity” and no child rapists. Thankfully your taxpayer UK pounds are hard at work trying to prevent these sorts of horrific things happening on a news channel you aren’t required to fund and you certainly aren’t required to watch.

## The long hand of the state

The internet (and Bitcoin if it wasn’t suppressed from birth) theoretically at least presented the opportunity for individuals and communities to interact and discuss topics that haven’t been sanctioned by the BBC from the comfort of your bedroom. What these startup news channels are showing is that in a world of websites and YouTube channels a state issued channel number or license to operate isn’t required to get your content out. Companies like Facebook, Twitter (now X) and YouTube initially built incredibly good software using skilled software developers who at various points didn’t meet the “diversity” requirements of the present day. The outputs (the software or the code running on your machine) were of a very high standard and the users didn’t care if a transsexual, Chinese female who sometimes identifies as a cat contributed code to it or not. But if you thought that signalled the permanent victory of free speech and market competition over the state you’d have been mistaken. What we saw during the end of the first Trump term, the BLM riots and the Covid pandemic was the state fightback. The state managed to both internally infiltrate these companies and externally exert pressure on these companies to clamp down on individuals and topics that didn’t align with the state sanctioned spectrum of views. It cumulated in the sitting President of the United States being booted off Twitter and unable to communicate with his followers using that platform. The sitting President of the United States. In the United States. If the sitting President of the United States succumbs to these forces what hope does the Tommy Robinson or the Joe Bloggs have? The kind of rug pulling these platforms have engaged in is particularly heinous because you can spend years of your life publishing content and building a following only for your presence on that platform to be digitally assassinated because a few employees at those companies didn’t agree with your views. With in many cases zero explanation and no legal recourse. And that is if you managed to evade the digital assassination to build up a following in the first place. If these platforms spot you early enough they can just stop anyone finding your content organically through search and every view and every follow you obtain can only be through a determined pursuit on the behalf of the consumer to find that content at the expense of all alternatives. “I want X” gets a response of “Are you sure you don’t want Y”, “Ok but are you sure you don’t want Z?” until the consumer just assumes that content doesn’t exist anymore. It is the equivalent of imprisoning you in a digital dungeon. You’re still alive, you haven’t been digitally assassinated but no one can find you or communicate with you. Again with zero explanation and no legal recourse. The code for these digital assassinations or these digital dungeons isn’t published, it isn’t open source. And even if it was open source employees at the company can just override the code in the cases where a digital assassination or a new digital dungeon is required. The promise that these platforms initially showed has been quashed by the long hand of the state. Not content at ruling over the world of bits the UK state is now pursuing an Online Safety Bill to regulate online speech and media. So don’t like the “diversity” agenda and want to go back to a diverse meritocracy? Not only will you be digitally assassinated or digitally imprisoned the state will find a way to imprison you in the world of atoms. Long live the state comrade.

## The Covid pandemic - the state’s wet dream

The UK state in peacetime has already got its tentacles in every aspect of your life from what you watch on the television, what your favourite online platform is able to recommend to you to watch next, what you eat, how that food is produced, the tap water you drink, what new technologies are funded and what new technologies aren’t, what crimes are investigated and what crimes are ignored and indeed what is a crime in the first place. Today if I provide an ATM in the UK so someone can buy Bitcoin with physical cash I can be arrested and fined. But it is during national emergencies when the UK state hoovers up the few remaining freedoms that UK citizens have. The Covid pandemic presented the first truly national emergency since World War 2 and we got to see what life is like when you surrender every freedom to the state. To start with the slow initial response to give the virus the chance to enter the country and spread like wildfire while other countries like the US imposed early travel restrictions from China. Then daily government briefings that you were essentially forced to watch because it would outline whether you had to wear a mask or not, whether you were allowed to leave your house and for how long, whether you were allowed to mix with anyone else outside of your household and how many people you were allowed to mix with, how far you could venture from your home and which supermarkets you could enter. As we now know this was all while the people in charge of making these decisions, reversing these decisions and then reinstating these decisions were having parties and handing out hundreds of million pound contracts to their friends to provide products they had no prior experience providing and in many cases failed to satisfy the terms of. Up to 40 billion pounds was spent on the Track and Trace app that barely worked, no one used and was eventually shelved. This continued over the course of the best part of two years. We had Rishi Sunak, later rewarded with the post of UK Prime Minister, introducing the “Eat out to help out” scheme with the government (taxpayer funded of course) paying 50 percent of people’s bills to eat out in restaurants only to soon go back into a state enforced lockdown again. No additional protections around care homes where the elderly and infirm were housed and no ability for loved ones to see them before they died. Every person was under the same restrictions even though it was clear from early on that Covid posed a much greater risk to the old and a very low risk to the young. Then we had the introduction of the Covid vaccine. The government declared it “safe and effective” when all vaccines pose risk of side effects especially new vaccines which haven’t been tested over the long term. They threatened to impose travel restrictions, work restrictions and restrictions on where you could eat and drink if you didn’t take the vaccine. We now know GCHQ, the UK’s version of the NSA, was cracking down on online discussion of the potential long terms risks of the vaccine and whether the vaccine was as effective as it was being marketed as. One day the government was stating the vaccine prevented the spread of Covid, the next day the government was stating it didn’t. What about the opposition parties? Surely they were challenging the decision making and questioning whether younger people should be locked down for two years and be forced to take the vaccine when Covid posed very little risk to them. Zero. If anything they were fighting for even longer lockdowns, even greater state imposed restrictions and more forceful threats to take the vaccine whatever the person’s circumstances. The cherry on top was the government briefings encouraging the public to have weekly clapping sessions to encourage NHS staff who were utterly failed by the incompetence of the state. It all seems like a bad dream now but it happened. And afterwards? In the spirit of regularly sweeping the state’s sinister incompetence under the rug an inquiry was set up so lawyers could be paid by the taxpayer to ultimately after many years and millions spent find no one responsible. Over 200,000 dead, the economy trashed, large swathes of small businesses bankrupt, a resumption of Bank of England quantitative easing debasing the currency to pay everyone to sit at home for 2 years and the state finances plundered to enrich cronies during a national emergency. Long live the state comrade.

If nothing changes after all that and business just continues as usual what has to happen for the public to realize that they are being taken for fools by the state they continue to fund with their taxes? Their elderly relatives being slaughtered in care homes through negligence, their younger relatives being lied to and cajoled into a taking a new vaccine multiple times when it wasn’t at all clear Covid posed a greater risk to their health than the vaccine itself. Of course the political and media circus wants to move on and avoid accountability, they want to pretend it never happened and they are relying on the public having goldfish brains or blaming it all on a single boogeyman: Putin, Brexit, Matt Hancock etc. But what more does the state have to do? Literally have government employees break into people’s homes and rape their daughters in front of them? The Covid pandemic should have resulted in an absolute overturning of UK politics. Like a plot from Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, every single branch of the state totally failed and each one has blood on their hands. Yet in 2024 the UK is going into an election with both major parties trying to make it a business as usual election. A banning of vapes here, a 1p cut in income tax rate here. Allegiance to the same political correctness and “diversity” agenda that left elderly relatives dying without being able to see loved ones for a final time. If the UK isn’t over and there is still a spark of hope that it can be turned around there has to be a major showing for new parties and individuals who previously got censored by the state and written off as racists, cranks and conspiracy theorists. Because if the state can just get away with it after all that there is nothing it can’t get away with.

## The 20th century UK state’s primary objective: managed decline

After the breakup of the British Empire and two world wars where the center of global power shifted from London to Washington DC it was inevitable that there was going to be a painful reckoning as the UK adjusted to not being the focal point of power, influence and wealth generation certainly in the West and arguably of the entire planet. But did this strategy of managed decline really have to last 80 years? And if it isn’t reversed today in 2024 will it ever be reversed? There are numerous empires such as the Greek and Roman empires that seemingly never did recover and although they still maintain a proud culture and popular tourist destinations the route for smart, ambitious Greeks and Italians to succeed today is to emigrate to the US. Is it inevitable that the UK becomes yet another Greece or Italy? Or is it possible that it takes inspiration from smaller states that never had empires such as Israel and Singapore and rebuilds as a larger, technologically advanced equivalent. All countries have their reasons for complacency. Australia for example has relied on natural resources for decades to ensure a high quality of life for its citizens and so the kind of skill and expertise required to build a globally competitive technology company like Apple or Google say just hasn’t been a priority. The UK’s problem has been its reliance on its history rather than its future to stay relevant. London will always be a critical financial center right? It once was the center of the British Empire. Global companies will always need a presence in the UK because you won’t find the skills and expertise to manage a multinational company anywhere else right? As the decades wear on and the British Empire and the world wars become a long distant memory it is not at all clear that this is or will always be the case. Unless a company from Israel or Singapore wants guidance on how to meet “diversity” or net zero requirements what does London or the UK have to offer? 70 million people is a decent sized market but compared to the US (300 million) or say India (1.4 billion) or China (1.4 billion) it is still pretty small. All the different branches of the UK state would say that’s an argument for staying in the EU and remaining part of a 450 million person market. And maybe it is if managed decline is the only possible strategy for the UK. Group together with a bunch of other European nations with a similar or worse problem post empires or post attempted empires and at least there will be strength in numbers. Cobble together an unelected European Commission with no democratic mandate or accountability to the European people and it won’t really matter. No one can afford to ignore a 450 million person market right? Although of course this wasn’t spelt out during the Brexit referendum campaign this is effectively what the decision came down to. Believe the UK can do better or continue with managed decline and huddling in the EU for strength in numbers. All the branches of the UK state wanted the latter. The UK people chose the former.

A key pillar in a strategy of managed decline is suppressing ambition, patriotism, a shared sense of national identity and that pesky desire to make a country great again. Brain drain is fine, if anything it should be encouraged. You don’t want smart people questioning why certain things are being done or not being done. You don’t want them questioning if their area really is being improved when it is swamped by immigrants from third world countries. But for those that stay you don’t want them grouping together under a flag and a pride for their national history demanding better than what the state wants for them. If you can you want to splinter those attempted groupings, demonize the leaders of those groupings, censor them, throw them in jail, give them criminal records (an experience Tommy Robinson and the Britain First leader Paul Golding can both attest to) and if possible convince the entire population that the national flag that their ancestors fought and risked their lives under now represents racism and violence. Just as the Nazis encouraged the waving of the Nazi emblem rather than the German flag, in recent times UK streets are filled with people waving the Palestinian flag for a nation state that doesn’t exist rather than the UK flag. In the week that I write this (w/c February 19th 2024) “From the river to the sea”, a slogan calling for the destruction of Israel was beamed onto Big Ben next to the UK Parliament. Discussions inside the UK Parliament on the Israeli military action against the terror group Hamas were supposedly disrupted by the mounting Islamist terror threat outside. All in the same week as the London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, a Muslim, was blocking plans for a statue of the late Queen Elizabeth II and instead renaming London Overground lines to promote the “diversity” agenda.

It is worth remembering that the true heroes of various causes whether it be the Suffragettes fighting for women’s rights in the UK at the beginning of the 20th century or the Martin Luther Kings of the civil rights movement in the US in the middle of the 20th century suffered exactly the same fate as Tommy Robinson and Paul Golding have in recent times. Today the state despises white, working class males. I started watching a TV dramatic series “The Undeclared War” (Channel 4, a state owned TV channel) on GCHQ and cyber attacks and couldn’t make it through a single episode because the “diversity” agenda was just being forced down viewers’ throats. They described white males as “male, pale and stale” completely ignoring whether they were competent at their job or not. The hero was the teenage Asian female work experience student with no prior cyber security experience and no understanding of the existing cyber security systems but she was somehow able to thwart a cyber attack that the useless “male, pale and stale” long term employees were unable to do. This delivers two messages that are unrelenting across all UK media and culture today. Firstly, that white males can’t be good at their job and they are only there because of the racist patriarchy. And secondly, that you don’t have to work hard over a long period of time to build up expertise in a subject matter and then apply it in a security critical setting. Instead you can just show up as a teenage student with no experience and as long as you’re not “male, pale and stale” you’ll be able to transform national security. The UK military and security services have been diverse and competent in the past. Indeed the Gurkhas say fought on the side of the Allies in World War 2. But what has changed since then is that competence and a diverse meritocracy is no longer the aim. Instead the aim is the painting by numbers “diversity” and hatred for white, working class males whatever their qualities, abilities or work ethic. Which is quite the problem given that 80 percent of the UK population is white today and the white male population totals 28 million people. That’s a lot of people that Tommy Robinson and Paul Golding are standing up for.

Of course in a population of 28 million white males there are going to be a small minority that still hold truly racist or white supremacy views though it seems to be dwindling decade by decade. Certainly in the arena of sport, one rare industry in the UK where you still have a diverse meritocracy, individuals of all races and religions are able to succeed and are idolised by white male supporters. The fact that Mohamed Salah is Muslim, Son Heung-min is Korean or Bukayo Saka is black doesn't factor in most of the time. You certainly don't have lifelong Liverpool supporters stop supporting Liverpool because their star player is a Muslim or lifelong Arsenal supporters stop supporting Arsenal because their star player is black. Yet in other industries like finance, consulting, law and certainly in the sprawling state apparatus your skill and competence is secondary to your race and gender. In those industries the Erling Haalands and the Kevin De Bruynes are looked down on for being "male, pale and stale". Instead of picking the best players available to them Man City would have dropped Haaland and De Bruyne and played a black player or a Muslim player instead. This isn't just a "diversity" agenda. This is racism. It is just that racism that would have been directed towards black people a century ago is now being directed towards white people.

What perplexes me is that in a population of 28 million there are so few Tommy Robinsons and Paul Goldings willing to resist and fight back. There is no way in a million years a white Allied soldier would have returned from fighting in World War 2 and put up with racism towards him in his own country. Or that Winston Churchill would have stood aside for an ethnic minority leader during World War 2 because he was "male, pale and stale". It is unfathomable. But every time the state takes another step towards becoming more racist and more sexist towards white males today the white males just put with it. It is yet another reason why the UK state seems to despise Israel. Although Israel has a diverse society it wouldn't sit back and allow racism towards Jews in its own country. It wouldn't allow leaders and politicians to promote an agenda that looks down on and dismisses Jews for being Jewish. What would the point be of having a Jewish nation state if Jews were second class citizens in that nation state? Yet in the UK you have a predominantly white, Christian population and they are allowing themselves to be cast as second class citizens in that nation state. The frog is being slowly boiled and it is doing nothing about it. The state is very sly. It will find the rare examples of individuals being racist towards ethnic minorities whether that be a British 12 year old boy arrested for racially abusing the black footballer Wilfried Zaha on social media or the death of a black man 4000 miles away across an ocean (George Floyd) and use those examples to drum home the message that the racism problem is still with the white working class. Yet there is only one race being openly criticised for the color of their skin in supposedly respectable forums, there is only one race being forced out of organizations or denied promotions because of the color of their skin and there is only one race being mocked on state owned television channels for the color of their skin. And that race is not black or Asian people. That race is white British people.

## Now or never: the fightback

Today the numbers are on the white working classes' side. In a population of 67 million white British people make up the majority (80 percent). In a supposedly democratic system where it is one person, one vote that should be a large enough voting bloc to ensure the white working classes don't permanently become second class citizens in their own country. But the UK state is not on their side and that is the most powerful entity of all. We've already discussed the BBC and the media's ability to define the spectrum of an issue. On immigration (both legal and illegal) the "acceptable" center ground position in recent decades has been that arguing against mass immigration from third world countries is racist or far right. With that spectrum in place legal (we'll ignore illegal for now) net migration statistics have boomed. 750,000 net inwards migration in the year to December 2022 with similar figures in 2023. Where these people are coming from, what they potentially offer the country, whether they are the next Peter Thiel or the next Osama Bin Laden isn't discussed. Again in a football analogy it would be the equivalent of not caring whether you are signing Mohamed Salah or Osama Bin Laden. A Muslim star that lights up a cup final at the old twin towers of Wembley Stadium or a terrorist that lights up the Twin Towers of New York and brings a country to its knees by slaughtering thousands of innnocent civilians. The state seemingly doesn't care. But what it does seem to care about is eroding that white working class voting bloc. The area in which I grew up as a kid, Wembley in North London, barely has any white British people in it anymore. It is not even that white British people are the minority. When I get on a bus to Wembley I am nearly always the only white British person on the bus by the time I reach my destination and even I'm half Jewish. The entire bus is of a different race, speaking a different language and seemingly with greater allegiance and fondness to the country they came from than the country they're living in. In thirty years it has gone from a typical British working class area to what seems like a suburban slum of Mumbai. Other parts of London or other UK cities now seem like a suburban slum of Kabul or Islamabad. Did anyone vote for this? Did the Conservative or Labour government ever say "Vote for us. We'll turn your city into Kabul or Islamabad?". No. They threw the racism accusation at anyone who even broached the subject of "Is this government doing what we want? Is it in my interests if my hometown becomes Kabul or Islamabad? If I don't want this who am I supposed to vote for? And why are those options being derided in the mainstream media as racist or languishing in prison?". The sight of London and other UK cities being swarmed by Palestinian flags rather than UK flags has been a long time in the making. And who has their fingerprints all over it? You guessed it, the UK state.

When surveying the UK state apparatus today in 2024 you really are that Allied solider surveying that Nazi concentration camp or that Israeli soldier surveying the Gaza network of tunnels for the first time. What exactly is worth salvaging here? Don't get me wrong, when the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in the UK in 1948 I'm sure the founders never envisaged politicians enriching themselves as nurses struggled to save lives and loved ones perished alone in care homes. I'm sure when GCHQ was founded in 1919 the founders never envisaged it being used to suppress discussion of vaccine efficacy and safety and instead priortizing "diversity" over national security. I'm sure when the BBC was founded in 1922 the founders never envisaged repeated cover ups of scandals like "Sir" Jimmy Savile's child abuse or sympathizing with Hamas terrorists in Gaza. I'm sure when the Bank of England was founded in 1694 the founders never envisaged money printing on the scale the Bank of England has engaged in the last decade all whilst lying about it and trying to hide the scale of it from its citizens. But in 2024 we are where we are, you can't keep your head in the sand. These branches of the state, no doubt set up with the best intentions by well meaning, patriotic people are today rotting from the inside. On a case by case basis there may be things to salvage from these rotting corpses. But the people who should be making those evaluations are the people who identified these problems and were brave and courageous enough to attempt to prevent them from happening. There aren't many of these people. There are the Tommy Robinsons and Paul Goldings who were willing to go to prison to stand up for the white working classes. There are some politicians like Nigel Farage who fought for Brexit for many years and were derided for believing Britain could do better than cowering in an undemocratic European Union. There are politicians like Andrew Bridgen who today is determined to get to the truth on what we injected into our bodies during the Covid pandemic and what was motivating the threats from the state to ensure every person took the vaccine regardless of personal health considerations. These people do exist. But today they are on the edges of power and the state directed discourse. If the fightback is going to happen this needs to flip. The spineless state stooges need to be removed and the enemies of the state need to come in and survey the damage. Otherwise the white working classes will be waking up in 2050 and they will be the minority at the ballot box in their own country. 

## Controlled opposition: the state's Uncle Toms

I think it is inevitable the pendulum swings back from the extreme left wing and socialist ideologies that peaked during the Covid pandemic of 2020-2022. But the pendulum gently swinging back and resting at a less extreme center left position won't cut it for the UK after 80 years of managed decline. As I said earlier if there is any hope for the UK it needs a Trump on steroids. Not only is this individual going to be demonized, censored and suppressed by all branches of the UK state they are also going to suffer the same treatment from state adjacent media and Big Tech platforms which will do whatever the state tells them to do knowing that the state has the power to rug pull their business. A lot has been made of Elon Musk's 44 billion dollar acquistion of Twitter and rebranding to X.com in 2022 and alhough this is a step in the right direction (you can't really get worse than preventing a sitting US President from communicating with the US electorate) it is clear that the days of untrammelled free speech and finding individuals with perhaps niche shared interests is long gone. Even post Musk induced changes there are topics that when discussed will ensure your account gets suppressed such that no one sees your content and although some code has been published on the logic behind the digital dungeons (again a step in the right direction) X.com still maintains a private list of blacklisted topics and processes for digital assassinations that seem totally dependent on Musk's biases, moods and state strongarming (AlexFinnX, February 27th 2024). This Trump on steroids is going up against the most powerful Goliath in human history. Never before has a population been captive to Big Tech platforms with the illusion of free speech and digital freedom of movement but with the reality of state directed discourse. In the UK GB News and TalkTV are also a step in the right direction in the media landscape but the content is often sterilized and following the same talking points of the other mainstream news channels. Neither will give a platform to the Tommy Robinsons or Paul Goldings of the country and they generally just sweep up the unwanted TV personalities like Piers Morgan who have left the mainstream channels. New voices and new individuals who aren't tarnished by association with the scandal and mediocrity of the previous decades aren't really breaking through or given a platform. The strategy to fight the Goliath hence has to be incredibly nuanced and targeted. Building up a grassroots following in the world of atoms now that Covid based restrictions on the freedom of movement have been relaxed is going to be a critical part. Books and promotional materials can be purchased in the world of bits from independent websites when Amazon and Big Tech platforms refuses to sell them. Payments, donations and general fundraising can be done through Bitcoin and QR codes when the banks refuse an individual or an organization access to bank account. It is not going to be easy, far from it. But when all you have is a metaphorical sling and stones you have to make do with what you've got.

## Your ticket to the game

In a diverse meritocracy, which the UK clearly isn't in 2024, the only way to get a ticket to the game and not be a NPC (non-player character) is to hone a particular skill or build expertise in a science or technology. The upper classes can afford to study exclusively humanities and the arts and not scrutinize their views to data or test their abilities in the marketplace but the working classes do not have this luxury. If they are to escape from minimum wage jobs and/or pointless jobs that were only introduced to keep them occupied the working classes have to be able to clearly demonstrate their value. The "diversity" agenda suppresses the white working class majority but it hurts the ethnic minority working classes too if they care about testing the limits of their potential like David Goggins has done pushing his body to the brink and meticulously studying his mind during that process. The message from the upper classes to the ethnic minority working classes in the UK is "You are a victim in this racist society. There's a role for you in our painting by numbers hiring process even if you aren't skilled in anything." This is not to say writing isn't an important adjacent skill whether that be completing an application form or writing a convincing proposal. But without that skill or expertise you have nothing of merit to write about. The upper classes will tell the ethnic minority working classes "Your emotions as a victim have value. This evil white person will never know what it feels like to be a black person and so you can always lecture them about your emotions or feelings in any given day." But every single human has emotions or feelings in a given day. And if you are desperate to find something that gives them merit in a victimhood mentality you will find it. Maybe you're fat, maybe the opposite sex was mean to you once, maybe you're unattractive, maybe your parents were neglectful, maybe you were bullied once at school or in the workplace. Every single person will have reasons for a victim mentality. Whether the upper classes see those reasons as valid enough to carve out a path in a hiring process for those reasons is a different question but in a diverse meritocracy it shouldn't matter. The upper classes shouldn't even be in that position to make those decisions unless they have also demonstrated excellence in a particular skill or expertise.

There are still plenty of opportunies in the world of atoms for truly skilled or experienced practitioners but at least in the UK the opportunities in the world of bits are severely underestimated and misunderstood. No one from the upper classes to the working classes seems to have a handle on just how much the world of bits has embedded in our lives today such that even in the world of atoms you are using the world of bits as an interface to navigate the world of atoms. I suspect this is due to a number of reasons. Firstly, those who have built multibillion dollar companies in the world of bits, predominantly in Silicon Valley in recent decades, don't generally come to countries like the UK encouraging its citizens to build their expertise. They are looking for captive users to increase their bottom lines or to misdirect to leave the path clear for their own companies' success. They aren't looking for skilled upstarts trying to get a foothold in their industry. This is why you see fawning discussions between say the current UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk (November 2023) on the threats of artificial general intelligence (AGI) all while Elon Musk has a company (Neuralink) inserting chips into people's brains. If you are truly worried about AGI destroying humanity it probably isn't a great idea to give that AGI access to directly manipulate humans' brains. But this kind of discussion perfectly encapsulates the meeting of minds when the useless British upper classes meet a canny operator from Silicon Valley seeking to misdirect. Anyone with deep expertise in a scientific or technical topic will know ChatGPT spouts utter nonsense once you test its limits and poses as much danger to humanity as a single human with an IQ of 80 and without a physical body to move around in. Yet you'd have no idea of this if you listened to UK politicians and the UK media.

## Going through the ethical turnstile

Once you've honed a particular skill or built a deep expertise in a science or technology you've obtained your ticket to the game. It is difficult, it takes a long time and certainly requires more effort than declaring "I'm black, have emotions and hence should be hired to discuss those emotions". With that ticket you now enter the ethical turnstile. The first decision is where you apply your skillset. The hardest, most impactful and ultimately most financially rewarding route is to build something new from nothing. A society that cares about generating tax revenues to pay for national defense and public services (seemingly not the UK in 2024) should be encouraging the smartest and most able to pursue this route especially when the world of bits is dominated by American giants paying next to zero tax in the UK. It is the most stressful, requires round the clock focus, can't afford to succumb to the "diversity" agenda and presents a high probability of ultimate failure but within a large corporation it is next to impossible to generate millions, hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars from nothing. And if you want that large corporation to pay a reasonable rate of tax on the wealth you generate for them it is literally impossible. It may well be that without understanding a particular industry or the nature of real world problems that need solving a new graduate would be better placed learning about them within a large corporation or organization for the first few years. But the ultimate goal for the smartest and most able in a healthy society must be to create wealth from nothing. Anything less is the Mohamed Salahs and Bukayo Sakas of an industry settling with playing in the second or third tier of English football. For IT graduates or skilled software developers in 2024, the Big Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Meta are just so huge that finetuning a tiny cog at the edge of their infrastructure probably isn't good preparation for trying to build a new business from scratch a few years down the line. But want to build a technology company in health, finance, law, education, defense etc? Go work in that industry and work out where the opportunities are. Most of them are floundering in the world of bits and so the opportunities are endless. Assuming you experience some success, pick a problem that people really want solving, obtain funding, users and ultimately revenues the next ethical turnstile you go through is whether to cash in and sell to a large corporation. Almost without fail large corporations seem to acquire startups to destroy them. They present a threat to their lumbering business, they embarrass them showing what small groups of people are capable of and they catch large corporation's shareholders eyes wondering why these problems aren't getting solved within the corporation anymore. The easiest thing is to pay the startup to go away, enrich the startup founders and slowly collapse the startup within the corporation. After years of stress and round the clock focus you can't really blame the startup founders for taking the payday. Assuming they pay tax on the payday their society benefits too. But if the Big Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Meta had taken the early payday offered to them they wouldn't be around today. It is the David Goggins of the world that refuse to cave, cash in and instead continue running.

Perhaps the hardest ethical turnstile of all is the next one that presents itself. This is where you attract the attention of the state. You think the initial Twitter founders ever thought they would kick a sitting US President off their platform? You think the initial Google founders ever thought that search results would need to be tweaked to promote the "diversity" agenda? You think that the initial Amazon founders ever thought that certain books wouldn't be able to be sold because they challenged the state narrative? Or you think Elon Musk ever thought he would be chatting to UK Prime Ministers about the illusory threat of artificial general intelligence (AGI) when he was designing SpaceX rockets and Tesla cars? At this point the company is so large it is inevitable it gets infiltrated by the state. In the Bitcoin industry, the industry I'm most familiar with, I've seen the same happen to a company like Coinbase that initially created the best software for buying and selling of Bitcoin only to turn to ramming all kinds of total scams and Ponzi schemes down their customers' throats (derogatorily labelled s\*\*\*coins). I've obviously never reached this ethical turnstile or the one before it for that matter hence I don't know what I'd do or be able to do. But when the state is as incompetent and/or malicious as it is in the UK in 2024 not only do fewer and fewer people reach this ethical turnstile it is frightening what the UK state would do to them if they did. The US state is clearly far from perfect as we've seen in recent years with the evolution of these tech giants but the UK state is a complete nightmare. At least in the US they have churned out wealth generating companies before neutering them. The UK state has neutered their people's ambition before they have even started.

## The role of state education in leaving the white working classes to rot

In football the most promising kids and teenagers from all classes, races, religions etc are scouted, offered places in academies and given the support so that they have the best chance of maximizing and utilizing their potential as a professional footballer in their adult lives. They get access to the best coaches, the best training facilities and they get to compare themselves and compete with other highly talented youngsters. Do they all succeed as professional footballers? Of course not. Is it possible that a late bloomer ends up having a more successful career than someone offered an academy place at an early age? Of course. But generally today's stars in the Premier League were found early and invested in early. If they move to another club they can generate transfer fees for the original club academy that invested time and money in them. And with the connections they build with future professionals, coaches and support staff it is possible that even if they don't make it as a professional footballer they can still find a role in the industry as say an agent or coach. Compare that experience to a white working class kid in the UK who is gifted academically. He goes to the local state school, coasts, is amused by how little work he needs to do to maintain good grades, gets bored and ends up disrupting other kids' education. When the exams come around he works harder and comes out of that school top of his year. In comparison to the upper classes he gets zero support for particular admissions processes to the top universities but he gets into a decent university on the back of his grades. He spends two and a half years at that university getting drunk every night and only when his grades start dropping to concerning levels does he start studying hard and manages to leave university with a Upper Second and a Masters in a science despite his professors (barring one) previously writing him off. He then goes into the world of work as an adult with no real network to speak of on any of the key metrics that matter: wealth, influence, intelligence and ambition. It is the complete opposite experience of the gifted footballer. Is it any wonder that the Premier League is beamed into television screens all around the world while the startup scene languishes in comparison to the US or Israel? Is it a surprise that the UK state has been phasing out and banning grammar schools, the nearest equivalent to a football academy which tries to identify gifted youngsters, provide the best education programs to them and allows them to compare themselves and compete with other gifted youngsters? In a national strategy of managed decline smart, white working class kids are surplus to requirements. They don't meet the painting by numbers hiring requirements and the state doesn't care if they spend their whole lives doing minimum wage work.

Again if you truly wanted a diverse meritocracy rather than this hideous upper class oligopoly with a sprinkle of painting by numbers "diversity" what would you do differently? The first step would be to move as far away as possible from the socialist mindset that every white working class person is the same and should be subject to exactly the same education contrived by the incompetent and/or malicious state. As always in a socialist system the upper classes aren't subject to what the white working classes are subjected to. They go to fee paying schools, invest in one on one tutoring and if their kid shows a particular interest or talent for a subject they can ask a friend or pay an expert to speak to their kid about that subject. Despite the state education system and state media giving the impression that the only people that matter are royalty and politicians there are still businesses in the UK, many formed pre the national strategy of managed decline, that still and always will need skilled practitioners in science and technology. Why the state with its upper class humanities graduates thinks it should exclusively make decisions on a universal state education system is just another layer of the complacent arrogance that it shows in every aspect of its sprawling empire. There are many towns and cities especially in the north of England and Scotland that have fallen into abject poverty and present no hope or opportunity to kids growing up there. What do they have to lose by shaping their education to leave them best placed to get jobs at whatever businesses have a presence in their area? Can their prospects get any worse than they currently are? Will they really lose out by not learning about Henry VIII and World War 2 and instead learning about accountancy, business, software development, engineering, whatever skills those local businesses need? Trump asked black voters in 2016 "What do you have to lose?" These towns and cities have nothing to lose. The upper class, humanities graduates of the state have failed them and other than writing these towns and cities off as failed historical ruins they can't sink any lower. They are in a state of cardiac arrest and practically any electric jolt you can give them is better than the status quo.

Is there a role for some kind of state oversight? Of course. An education program for extremist terrorists shouldn't be allowed, nor should an education program teaching students to hate their country's history and values. An education program trying to stoke up race wars by teaching that a certain race has permanent victimhood status and another race has permanent oppressor status should be clamped down on, not that the state seems to be doing anything to clamp down on teachers spouting critical race theory in 2024. Similarly an education program encouraging kids to permanently mutilate their bodies when they go through a teenage phase should be clamped down on, again not a priority for the state in 2024 who would rather lock up the parents for protecting their kids. There are two falsehoods that the state has brainwashed generation after generation with. One is that the state cares about its citizens more than say a business. It doesn't. Businesses want your money and politicians want your vote. The state does not care about you and your family any more than a business does. The second is that the state cares about kids' welfare as much as parents and a family structure. It doesn't. There will always be cases of terrible parenting and thankfully rare cases of parental abuse of their kids. But as a generalization there is no comparison. The state does not care and parents care more than anything else about their kids. By empowering the state over parents you just ensure that terrible, indifferent parenting is the norm and muddy the waters for those good parents who left alone without state interference would ensure much better outcomes for their kids. The state is a universal incompetent and indifferent parent. Are there incompetent and indifferent parents too? Of course. But there are also competent, loving parents. And they shouldn't be in a battle with the state on how to raise and educate their kids. Again "What do you have to lose?" when you look at the depths the state has sunk to in recent years. The state would do nothing for decades as "Sir" Jimmy Savile roamed the childrens' wards and Muslim grooming gangs roamed the streets of Huddersfield. The state is not your friend and it certainly isn't your loving parent.

## Brexit - the revolution that never happened

"The victory of the Leave campagin owed more to the fundamental dsyfunction of the British Establishment than it did to any brilliance from Vote Leave. Despite having the support of practically every force with power and money in the world (including the main broadcasters) and controlling the timing and legal regulation of the referendum, they blew it. This was good if you support Leave but just how easily the whole system could be taken down should be frightening for everybody" Dominic Cummings

In June 2016 the UK had a referendum on whether it should leave the European Union (EU) approximately four decades after joining (1973). As is usual with elections the media covered it 24/7, the politicians thrilled in their increased celebrity status, battle buses were bought, 33 million votes were cast and the voter turnout was a very healthy 72 percent. According to the Electoral Commission the referendum cost 129 million British pounds. Sitting in a Californian co-working space I didn't give the Brexit side a chance. All the major UK political parties opposed it, the UK state and state adjacent media opposed it, the Bank of England opposed it, the civil service refused to assist Brexit supporting politicians and the sitting US President (Barack Obama) opposed it. Obama visited the UK in person stating in a speech the UK would be at the "back of the queue" for a US trade deal if it voted for Brexit before being warmly greeted by Prince William and Prince Harry. The Canadian Bank of England governor, Mark Carney described the prospect of Brexit as the most significant risk to the UK's financial stability. (After the vote he warned leaving the EU without a deal could result in house prices crashing 30 percent.) To top it all off a MP campaigning against Brexit was shot days before the vote, a tragedy that was used to demonize Brexit supporters further. And yet despite all that the UK electorate voted by a narrow margin (52 percent to 48 percent) to leave the EU. This was a Trump sized shock and really should have been a wake up call that the UK people no longer believed the state's lies and threats. As a commenter (Roseanne Curran) on the political strategist Dominic Cummings' blog put it "Thank you for a good job, well done. Exciting times ahead". But alas. Instead Brexit was delayed in Parliament, in the upper chamber (the House of Lords) in the UK Supreme Court, no doubt by the vast majority of the civil service and only completed after another general election in December 2019 in which the now Conservative leader Boris Johnson campaigned to "Get Brexit done" as if the referendum result wasn't a clear enough instruction in the first place. Three years the UK population will never get back. Little did they know they were a year away from being subjected to the state's response to Covid and another two years of being locked up in their homes watching the daily government briefings deciding which one of their freedoms was going to be taken away on any given day. In summary I think it is fair to say Brexit did not deliver the revolution it promised and the two years of Covid lockdowns served to demolish the UK small business landscape and government finances almost as a state enforced punishment for voting the wrong way. In the upcoming national election (2024) "Sir" Keir Starmer is the strong favorite to become Prime Minister, an ardent opponent of Brexit and someone who argued for even longer, more stringent Covid lockdowns than the mere two years. Assuming he completes a full term that will end in 2028 or 2029 which will be 12 years from the Brexit referendum vote.

Now after 12 years you really should be able to see some dividends from a supposedly significant decision like leaving the EU. But for the vast majority of those 12 years the state has tried to prevent it from happening, tried to stall progress on delivering those dividends, locked the population up in their homes for two years and installed unelected leaders who seem determined not to deliver on any of the opportunities Brexit presented in the first place. It is yet another example of the slyness of the state. They haven't been able to deliver the economic crash or the property crash they warned about but they have delivered on neutering Brexit to such an extent that the electorate looks back over the last 12 years and is utterly devoid of hope that anything can be changed. Even after a once in a generation referendum in which the people managed to (somehow) deliver a result every branch of the state was determined to prevent, even after all that, barely anything changed. Northern towns and cities are still in abject poverty, third world immigrants still swamp their local areas and the potential Brexit was supposedly going to unleash is nowhere to be seen. And like that Brexit was gone. Extinguished by the usual suspects.

The Brexit vote should have led to the dismantling of the state, the bonfire of EU regulations and the chaos of a Trump first term. After taxes had poured in from all sides to fund the state machine whose primary objective was to prevent the Brexit side winning it couldn't even achieve that. Half of those taxes presumably paid by taxpayers who actually wanted the Brexit side to win and so were forced to fund the opposite of what they wanted and the opposite of what they ultimately voted for. This highlights again why your plain vanilla Trump isn't enough in the UK and you need the Trump on steroids. The state is too powerful, has its tentacles in every possible crevice and even the strawmen and strawwomen who put their faces on a campaign against the state's wishes delivered next to nothing as a result. It goes without saying that this is not the sign of a healthy country or a healthy democracy. Representatives can swan around the globe discussing their "beacon of democracy" and "mother of all parliaments" all they like but if you spend years on one particular issue, you ask your electorate to participate in a once in a generation referendum and then you don't deliver anything as a result your democracy has flatlined. You are wasting people's time and you are burning taxpayers' hard earnt money all for a political charade and an ego trip. You might as well just install a dictator for life like in North Korea, China or nominally Russia, stop burning taxpayer cash and they can make the decisions on whether to stay in the EU or not.

## Human rights for the terrorists and child rapists, zero rights for the victims

In a supposedly developed, first world society there has to be a balance of rights between the accused and the accuser or the apparent victim. Principles such as "innocent before proven guilty" are there to prevent lives being ruined by false accusations which don't stand up to scrutiny in court. You cannot just automatically "believe all victims" like the "Me too" (2017) collective hysteria suggested because some of those supposed victims will be lying. Some will be seeking revenge, some will be seeking attention, some will regret their past actions and seek to pass the blame to someone else and others will be seeking a payday. You can't throw say a US President in jail for 10 years because a woman accuses him of a sexual assault that according to her occurred decades ago with no evidence other than her word. Hence there is a legal system to scrutinize accusations and assess whether the accused is guilty of those accusations. But like everything else in the UK the legal system seems to be rotting from the inside and the entire pathway from accusation to court judgment to sentencing seems to have collapsed. With crime plaguing cities all over the country from child sexual abuse to murder to rape to burglaries why do the police even consider arresting a 12 year old boy for misguided insults sent to a footballer on social media? A 12 year old boy whilst other 12 year olds are being groomed for sexual abuse? How does any human brain decide to spend police resources on something like that? Should that 12 year old child have been disciplined by his parents and say his school for sending those racist messages? Of course. Were those messages unacceptable? Of course. But he is a 12 year old boy and there are adult grooming gangs out there. What is wrong with them?

Let's first be clear on what these grooming gangs are doing to kids in towns and cities all over the country. Plied with alcohol and drugs, raped, passed around so they are raped multiple times, beaten, enslaved and ultimately blackmailed by their abusers. All while the majority of the perpetuators becry "racism" if these crimes are investigated by the police. In the rare cases that these crimes go to trial and the accused are found guilty the BBC, the legal system and the state will argue for millions of taxpayer money being spent defending the human rights of these perpetuators all while the victims languish in poverty with their lives in ruins. This is not that balance of rights you would expect in a supposedly developed, first world society. That is a third world hellhole. In El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has built vast prisons and implemented policies that have reduced the homicide rate from 38 per 100,000 in 2019 to 7.8 in 2022 (New York Times, February 2024). What do BBC journalists do? Travel to El Salvador, paid for by the British people's compulsory license fee to criticise those policies on the basis of human rights. All while children are being groomed for sexual abuse in towns and cities all over their home country. Are there human rights concerns with locking up such large numbers of people in such a short space of time? Of course. Will there be a large legal backlog to work through to assess which of those prisoners are innocent and don't pose a risk to their societies? Of course. But why does the BBC only care about the human rights of the criminals? Why does it never raise concerns of the human rights of those murdered and raped? Whose human rights matter more? A 12 year old sexually abused by a grooming gang or the grooming gang itself? Why is it ok to spend millions of taxpayer money on a legal case determining whether that grooming gang is deported or not while the abused 12 year old retreats to her abject poverty in a northern city completely let down by the authorities her family pays taxes to to protect her? And why is Tommy Robinson thrown in prison for raising her concerns in public? This is not the UK that our ancestors grew up in. This is a sick and evil society. 

## Itamar Ben-Gvir - Offering hope for Israel's future

With the current and longest serving Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu aged 74 the obvious question is what next? After a lifetime defending and rebuilding Israel in the military and political arenas will someone be able to pick up the mantle and not succumb to the predators running amok in the UK and the West. The best hope seems to be the individual getting the most heat from those in the process of destroying their own societies. An effective rule of thumb in today's upside down world is to find those who are being demonized in the mainstream media, work out what is driving that hatred and more often than not it is because their loyalties lie with their country and their religion rather than the global super rich. In Itamar Ben-Gvir's case he has spent his life worried about his family's and his community's safety in the West Bank (referred to as Judea and Samaria within Israel). His wife Ayala recently stated "I live in Hebron, mother of six sweet kids, travel through terrorism-ridden roads, married to the most threatened man in the country, and yes, I have a gun. Deal with it" (The New Yorker). Whilst the BBC's heroes are raping defenceless British kids, the Ben-Gvirs are defending Israeli kids and that's in essence why the BBC and the mainstream media despises them. Unlike Tommy Robinson in the UK who hasn't been able to make inroads into the mainstream media or mainstream politics and still gets arrested on a regular basis for innocuously walking around with his kids, Itamar Ben-Gvir has. He leads the Otzma Yehudit party and makes up a key part of Benjamin Netanyahu's current ruling coalition as Minister of National Security. He was in the process of setting up a national guard to focus on terrorism months before the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7th 2023. It is inevitable that whenever Israel completes its military action against Hamas in Gaza that the terrorist threat will be a major priority of the Israeli electorate in any future election. Although Ben-Gvir doesn't have some of the same skillsets that Netanyahu has refined during his long career it is also the case that the Israel Netanyahu would be passing on is much stronger than the Israel he inherited. Ben-Gvir wouldn't need an economic strategy for addressing hyperinflation, he wouldn't need a strategy for laying the foundations of a technology and startup ecosystem and it is arguable whether he'd need to be particularly convincing on why the two state solution is a non-starter. Of course Israel's enemies want to entrap it in a permanent cycle of terrorism, violence and military weakness but all Ben-Gvir needs to do is point to the events of October 7th. There is still much more work to do and Israel cannot afford to be complacent in any era. But the Israel Netanyahu will ultimately hand on is a much stronger Israel than the one Netanyahu inherited. And that ultimately will be Netanyahu's legacy.         

## Building up from first principles

There will be a national election in the UK in 2024 that barring a miracle will result in a Labour government or a Labour led coalition government. On the most important issues (Brexit, Covid, the economy, "diversity", crime and human rights) Labour have been on the wrong side of the Conservatives. As the Conservatives have been dragged ever leftwards the left wing party inevitably takes positions even further left than that. Hence it is reasonable to assume that a Labour government will be even worse than the Conservatives. Thankfully unlike the decade of the Labour government in 1997-2007 this time they don't have a charismatic leader (Tony Blair), they don't have a Chancellor of the Exchequer that the media will build up as a Midas like figure (Gordon Brown, who ironically sold half the nation's gold at the bottom of the gold market) and they don't have a spin doctor at the peak of his powers (Alastair Campbell). It is also widely understood by traditional Conservative voters that the "Conservative" government of 2010-2024 has ended up being nothing more than a marketing gimmick with a rotating door of different leaders. All seeking to be the true "heir to Blair" and a continuation of New Labour. So there will be an opportunity in 2028/2029 for a true right wing party that wasn't present say at the end of Blair and New Labour's first term. What state the country will be in then and whether there is anything to salvage is a different question. But even with the brain drain of the recent decades I highly doubt that in a population of 67 million people it isn't possible to find a few hundred people who wouldn't normally enter politics, who could earn much more money in the private sector but are so appalled by what is happening to their country that they want to at least try to pull the oil tanker around. Ideally they would have gone the Trump route and become wealthy before entering politics but other than the permanently rich upper classes, some footballers and some ethnic minority actors I'm not sure if you could find a few hundred people who have been able to generate serious wealth in this country in recent decades. So it may well be that those few hundred people will need donors domestically or from abroad.

Do you need money and how much money do you need? If mainstream media channels refuse to give your Tommy Robinsons or Joe Bloggs a platform so that they can build name recognition you are effectively in the same position as a startup business trying to acquire customers. In the Tommy Robinson case you are also fighting against the tide of years of demonization in the mainstream media and the branding of being a criminal with some prison stays on your CV. Rather than starting at zero you are starting at a very large negative number. To make progress in turning this around would potentially need even more money than a startup starting at zero and with nonexistent brand recognition. Compare this to the experience of the royal family who get the equivalent of millions of dollars of free publicity in the mainstream media every day driving home the message that these people are important to people's lives and worth idolising when in reality the opposite is generally the case. One difference versus a startup business is that to become a MP you can focus your resouces on your chosen constituency numbering in the tens of thousands of people rather than the tens of millions of people. You can make significant progress on the ground assuming you have large amounts of time to invest in voter canvassing and you are comfortable approaching strangers. This is where the Trumps of the US have a much greater advantage than your Trumps of the UK. A US President doesn't need to be elected to represent a particular local area prior to running for the US President whilst a UK Prime Minister must not only be elected to lead a political party he or she also needs to have been elected as a MP for a particular constituency. If they are not a MP they are unable to enter the race to become UK Prime Minister. It is quite possible that Trump would have struggled with the minutiae of rubbish collections and road potholes as a local MP on that prerequisite stepping stone to running for Prime Minister. Or perhaps with his wealth he would have just delegated most of the responsibilities and succeeded in doing the bare minimum. He had incredible name recognition prior to running for political office after all, he had an incredible network through his career as a businessman, he understood the political system and he had his own money to spend without needing to rely on donors.

## The curious case of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings

Most of the modern UK Prime Ministers who have lasted for relatively long periods of time have achieved it due to a partnership with a closely aligned, generally loyal Chancellor of the Exchequer. Margaret Thatcher had Nigel Lawson, Tony Blair had Gordon Brown and David Cameron had George Osborne. In all of these cases it was a genuine partnership of equals with no obvious junior partner. If anything you could argue that the nominally junior role of Chancellor was regarded as the smarter one driving policy decisions with the nominally senior partner fronting up those policy decisions with the media and opposition parties. In the technology world you see a similar dynamic with CEOs (Chief Executive Officers) and CTOs (Chief Technology Officers). Steve Jobs was the face and public voice of Apple but even he would admit that Steve Wozniak was the smarter technologist driving the development of early Apple products. The skillsets for these two roles are very different. Decision making based on logic and data does not require any charisma whatsoever whilst the media seems to value charisma over all else including competence. Similarly computers, programming and software development do not require charisma at all. A computer will ignore how charismatic you are and will execute code regardless of whether that code was written by Steve Jobs or a lifeless robot. It gets a little more complicated when you start to think about groups of humans writing code as the computer doesn't care about charisma but the humans potentially do. Even so programmers will generally be motivated by better, more experienced programmers who are capable of solving their problems. In the software world problems are bugs, vulnerabilities and code that fails to execute or exits with an error message. On the charisma spectrum Boris Johnson is potentially a 10. Without Boris Johnson fronting up the Brexit campaign you would expect that the UK would still be in the EU especially as the 52:48 winning margin was so narrow. So why after completing two terms as Mayor of London, widely considered as effective especially when compared to his predecessor and successor, was he unable to complete a single term as Prime Minister and presided over one of the most horrifying state failures during Covid? Although there are certainly questions over the (in)competence of everyone from his Cabinet to his civil servants to his background staff and indeed questions over whether he himself was entirely unsuited to front up a response to an unexpected national emergency of which he was unable to understand or process, there was the additional problem that he was missing his Nigel Lawson. His Chancellor during Covid was Rishi Sunak, not only more loyal to the Cameron, Osborne side of the party who were fiercely anti-Brexit (although peculiarly Sunak did seem to support Brexit during the campaign perhaps for strategic reasons) but also whose resignation led to Johnson being driven out as Prime Minister during his first term with Sunak later taking over himself. The media perception and arguably the reality was that the partnership that drove the Brexit campaign's success and Johnson's brief reign as Prime Minister was the partnership between Johnson and an unelected strategic advisor, Dominic Cummings.

There were a couple of obvious problems with this partnership that weren't specific to the individual. First of all Cummings was unelected, he wasn't a MP and so unlike previous Chancellors Cummings could be demonized by the media and opposition parties as pulling the strings of the administration without a democratic mandate to do so. Secondly he had no direct control of the nation's purse strings that a Chancellor nominally does. If Sunak wanted to pay the UK population to stay at home during multiple Covid lockdowns and pay people to eat out in restaurants in between lockdowns someone in Cummings' position would be unable to prevent it without getting the Prime Minister involved. Then we have to delve into the persona of Cummings himself which clearly requires greater degrees of speculation and personal opinion. From reading his blog posts and following his recent career through the prism of the mainstream media he seems like a rare publicly known individual that can identify the multitude of problems that the UK faces after 80 years of managed decline and does actually care enough to dedicate time into thinking about the nature of those problems. But unless he is keeping longer term plans up his sleeve he seems to be much weaker at formulating potential long term solutions and often seems no less scatterbrained than Johnson himself. In a partnership where Johnson had the charisma covered it is highly questionable whether Cummings brought to the table the temperament, the long term strategy, the ability to build alliances and the ability to manoeuvre around enemies. He has been involved in politics for approximately two decades and after all that time it is not clear at least publicly if he has any allies left that he doesn't think are entirely useless. In a population of 67 million people it is highly doubtful that Cummings is the lone genius and that there aren't others either already in the fold or who could be brought into the fold that could help contribute to longer term solutions that Cummings supports. But from reading his blog posts it is not clear who those people are. Barring installing Cummings as Prime Minister and dictator for life he would need allies to deliver any potential solutions, not that he seems to be particularly clear on what those solutions would be. Anyone attempting to formulate solutions, especially long term solutions, has to be able to identify where their personal weaknesses and blind spots are. It is not clear that Cummings has this epistemic humility. He has some very strong views on the importance of science and technology for example (that I personally agree with) but he himself graduated in a humanities subject (history). As I've found to my cost trying to catch up with those already trained in a skillset (software development, computer science) when you are trained in a different subject (mathematics) is a challenge. Some are just as smart as you, sometimes smarter than you, and if they also started training earlier than you it is very difficult to catch up let alone surpass them. I would also argue that mathematics gives you a stronger foundation to start exploring a different science or technology than the dataless, superficial narrative spinning of most history books. To be fair to Cummings he does highlight that he had to make decisions outside of his "circle of competence" and that he didn't have the "sort of expertise supporting the PM and ministers that is needed". Though he also hopes to be "largely redundant" within a year which is farcical given the long term problems he is attempting to solve. More evidence of being good at highlighting problems but flimsy in the formulation of long term solutions.   

In Cummings' defense Boris Johnson does sound impossible to manage. Cummings described Johnson as a "shopping trolley smashing between aisles" during Covid and hence a strategy of wheeling out a charisma machine during an election campaign but restraining him whilst governing seems as if it was harder in practice than it was in theory. Perhaps it would have been easier had a national emergency never presented itself and the focus had been on taking advantage of Brexit opportunities. Cummings suggests he knew Johnson was unfit to be Prime Minister in 2019 but thought trying to control him was the best of a bad job. By 2021 Cummings was trying to remove him "helped by officials in No.10 and Whitehall appalled by his behavior", behavior that included "pathological lying and surrounding himself with courtier fools". Johnson talked in public about growth and lower taxes but was the one who stopped plans for growth and lower taxes. Instead he was interested in trains, buses, bike lanes, a bridge or tunnel to Ireland and "buildings he could interpret in Roman Emperor terms". Perhaps most worryingly of all Johnson supposedly had a "money's just digits in a computer" attitude to taxes and spending. He saw the PM job as a "glorified version of being Mayor with better perks". Reading through Cummings' account of his time in No.10 you do start to wonder if whatever his own personal faults (everyone has faults) he was on a hiding to nothing with Johnson. But then according to Cummings Liz Truss was a "human handgrenade", Sunak "spends his time wading through endless detail and spreadsheets on fifth order matters" and perhaps most illuminating of all Netanyahu is a "disaster and the sooner he's replaced the better" despite Cummings admitting he'd "never followed Israeli politics in any detail". So you do wonder whether even if a potential leader presented themselves with a clone of Cummings' brain he'd still be seeking to oust them within a year or two.     

## The Cummings diagnosis

However, on identifying and analyzing the problems of the UK state there seems to be no one better. So what is the Cummings' diagnosis? Parts are obvious to anyone observing from the outside whilst other parts benefit from Cummings' experience of operating directly within the belly of the beast. You can't really start anywhere else other than with people. If you are trying to take advantage of Brexit opportunities having a team that didn't want Brexit to happen, still harbors resentment that their side lost and perhaps still hopes that the UK could rejoin the EU at some point in the future then you're not going to get very far. It would be the equivalent of trying to get a group of individuals to win a football match when they're determined to play cricket instead. The economic opportunity Brexit presented was to not be bound by EU regulations when trading with nations outside the EU. You obviously still have to follow EU regulations when trading with nations inside the EU but when you've left the EU you are no longer captive to those EU regulations when trading with nations that are outside. With the highest growing economies today in Asia, South America and Africa this allows you to embark on a multi alignment strategy. EU regulations and EU trade deals become irrelevant when trading with these economies. The other opportunity is to define what you think UK regulations should be. Do they become the bare minimum needed to trade with another country and hence fall back to whatever regulations that trading partner has? Does the UK define a new set of regulations, perhaps a subset of the existing EU regulations that makes trade a little more onerous than the bare minimum but still less onerous than EU regulations? There are a lot of questions to answer but the inevitable answer with a team of anti Brexit people is that the UK stays aligned with EU regulations entirely as if it had never left. Now that the UK has left the EU there is no excuse for the team to not be entirely filled with people that want to leverage the economic opportunities Brexit presents. That includes both elected politicians and civil servants who seemingly want jobs for life whilst also ignoring and resisting the will of the electorate.

Whilst in Number 10 as Boris Johnson's Chief Advisor Cummings released a much derided blog post calling for the hiring of "data scientists, project managers, policy experts, assorted weirdos". Transitioning from a mindset of "we blindly follow EU regulations" to "we can follow whatever regulations we want with a bare minimum set by the trading partner" certainly required a mentality shift. Asking the existing civil servants, generally upper class with humanities degrees and still bitter that Brexit happened at all to perform that shift was always going to be an uphill task. Hence hiring and firing was always going to be key. This is also where businesses (ideally small as well just large) who had experience of trading with these economies and aspirations to increase trade with these economies should have been coming to the fore. A lean and effective state that actually wants to grow its economy and actually wants its citizens to become wealthier solves problems for businesses and/or for the electorate. If it isn't solving problems or worse expanding the list of problems then it is just a millstone around its electorate's neck. Too often it takes the BBC's "holier than thou" approach where it thinks that nothing good can happen unless it is directed and driven by the state. And that the state is the only thing that can prevent bad things from happening. As we've seen with everything from Brexit to Covid it seems like today the opposite is the case. It prevents good things from happening and it turns bad things into horrendous things.

"To get good government you must have good people in charge of government. I have observed in the last 40 years that even with a poor system of government but with a good, strong people in charge people get passable government with decent progress. On the other hand I have seen many ideal systems of government fail. Britain and France between them wrote over 80 constitutions for their different colonies. Nothing wrong with the constitution, with the institutions and the checks and the balances. But the societies did not have the leaders who could work those institutions nor the people who respected those institutions. The leaders who inherited these constitutions were not equal to the job and their countries failed and their system collapsed in riots, in coups and in revolution" Lee Kuan Yew

The UK does not have good people in charge of government and it won't have for the next 4-5 years at the very least. It is clearly ironic that the country who wrote so many constitutions for its colonies all across the globe in previous centuries now can't even manage its own affairs effectively. Brain drain, a declinist mindset (as opposed to say a growth or a fixed mindset) and a desire to pillage the taxpayer base has got it here and as Lee Kuan Yew says without good people no system will get you out of that hole. However, a large part of the Cummings diagnosis is focused on systems hence we should explore or at least summarize his thinking here. The UK government system, according to Cummings, is a combination of extreme centralization of power, an extremely powerful bureaucracy closed to outside people, incentives to spew rules rather than solve problems and a media programmed to spread confusion. It possesses few of the error correcting mechanisms seen in say markets or the scientific method so it cannot improve itself let alone fix itself. If anything every failure or scandal is used to buttress the existing system. Set up a hideously long and expensive public enquiry enriching your lawyer friends, introduce more laws and/or state bodies led by insiders, find some outsiders to blame and demonize. Rinse and repeat. Rather than ruthlessly imposing simplicities so that there can be some transparency and accountability for actual outcomes, there is an ever expanding Byzantine web of subentities with overlapping responsibilities, conflicting objectives and a need to overreach into grey areas better left to the market to justify their existence. Elected ministers can't hire and fire and are almost never in a job long enough to acquire sufficient knowledge and understanding of their department. If Cummings is correct in this assessment you should not vote in elections unless you have local reasons for doing so. At a national level not only is your individual vote mathematically irrelevant but any individual you vote for won't be able to implement the manifesto they are running on. Your time would be much better spent voting with your wallet by considering your purchasing and investment decisions and voting with your feet by moving to countries (if you can) that have already implemented the policies you support. Your democracy is a mirage.

"If the people have lost faith completely in their democratic institutions because they cannot find people of caliber to run them, however good that system, it perishes. Ultimately it is the people who run the system who make it come to life." Lee Kuan Yew

As I write this I am pretty confident half of the UK population that voted for Brexit and most of the right wing have lost faith completely in British democratic institutions. Hence the system could perish but waiting around for that to happen does not seem like a good strategy to me. Not only could it take much longer than you hope the debris of that collapsing system could very well take you and your life prospects with it.      

## Flaws with the Cummings diagnosis

Building good software is fiendishly hard. Not only are there very few developers capable of designing and implementing a robust and adaptable architecture (and no Rishi Sunak AI does not solve this problem) the few of them there are generally won't work for a government salary. Even in the US where it is much more common for individuals to move between enterprise and government ambitious software projects are inevitably a complete disaster. The most shocking example in the last decade was "Obamacare" and the software backing the Affordable Care Act. As The Atlantic put it "The Obama adminstration was running the biggest startup in the world and they didn't have anyone who had run a startup or even run a business". The website crashed on launch and was beset with problem after problem despite the Obama adminstration throwing billions of dollars in its direction ($2.1 billion estimate by Bloomberg in 2014). Some of the best examples of software like Google or Facebook that probably peaked at a similar time to the Obamacare disaster succeeded for a number of different reasons. Firstly, the founders and later hires were incentivized to build something that worked and wouldn't later crumble as they held stock in the company. A consultant coming in to salvage the Obamacare software did not care what happened after he or she was paid and so was incentivized to make short term fixes and add sticking plasters. Secondly, Google and Facebook started small and organically with small numbers of skilled developers to get something that worked at a small scale first. Paul Graham of the startup accelerator Y Combinator in Silicon Valley is known for the saying "Do things that don't scale". Rushing straight from zero to nine rather than Peter Thiel's zero to one was arguably too big a task for even early Google or Facebook engineers not that Obamacare had access to them. Thirdly, unlike say Mark Zuckerberg who has been at Facebook (now Meta) for 20 years a US President or a political party can be kicked out and replaced in an election that typically happens every 4-5 years. If that ambitious software project is no longer a priority or worse abandoned entirely then what motivation does a skilled software engineer have to be associated with such a failure and have it on their CV especially as they most likely took a pay cut to work on it in the first place. Everything is pointing to the state doing the bare minimum when it comes to building or overseeing software projects itself. Any software it does build should be open source so taxpayers can see what they are getting for their money and if they are so inclined recommend changes to. Plus it should be as simple as possible so that it still stands a chance of being used in 5 years let alone 10 or 20. Every choice in that software stack should be as vanilla and as conservative as possible. Although Cummings appreciates how software has changed (eaten) the world and how Silicon Valley has almost exclusively built out that software it isn't clear that he understands how challenging it is for the state to succeed with ambitious software projects nor how consultants or Big Tech companies typically enrich themselves with taxpayer cash on the back of the stupidity (and/or corruption) of the state. The Sunaks of the state being misdirected down garden paths of fantasy like artificial general intelligence (AGI) by Silicon Valley billionaires is unfortunately not the exception but the rule.        

## The future for the UK: a grandparent in a care home or a rebirth? 

"America became the province of the mind, Israel the province of the heart" Benjamin Netanyahu

The United States is showing signs of age after a couple of centuries. Hopefully it is just at a particularly bad trough within an inevitable cycle. Indeed it has rebounded before from the Civil War and the Great Depression and I wouldn't bet against it rebounding again. But if America is showing signs of age where does that leave the UK? Depending on whether you measure its age from the Act of Union (1707) or the formation of England, Scotland and Wales (10th and 11th century) the UK is either marginally older or many centuries older than the US. Does it have a role anymore? Or is it that grandparent in a care home seeing out its last years reminiscing about its peak years whilst its children and grandchildren occasionally visit to pay their respects? Many signs are not good to put it mildly. The home of the industrial revolution has sat out most of the internet and software revolution which is increasingly running rings around the world of atoms. Not only does that mean UK citizens haven't built out the skills and expertise to contribute to this new world it also means that children don't strive to be the next Steve Wozniak or Mark Zuckerberg because it seems like an alien world. The wealth and adulation of footballers is on their doorstep but they don't think about the code that is driving TikTok recommendations, they just mindlessly consume them. When a young Netanyahu went to learn about the future and how Israel could thrive in it he didn't go to study in the UK he went to US. And this was in the 1970s. I certainly think it is possible that in future decades that the equivalent of a young Netanyahu might choose to stay and study in Israel rather than the US. It very much depends on whether the US can rebound and whether Israel can continue on its current trajectory. Personally I hope both happen and then this young Netanyahu equivalent will be spoilt for choice. But from a UK perspective the irrelevance of the UK in this conundrum should be chilling. As UK students deface a portrait of Lord Balfour of the Balfour Declaration (March 2024) at the University of Cambridge, nominally one of the UK's top two universities, even its role as a country sized history museum seems under threat. The future is extinguished, the present looks bleaker every day and the last thing to be done is to destroy the emblems of its past.   

For a rebirth to even be remotely possible a number of dominoes have to fall into place. The first and perhaps most critical piece is facing the stark realities. As Obama said in his 2008 election campaign "You can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig". In the world of bits it is impossible to effectively put lipstick on a pig. If software doesn't work, it crashes, it is insecure, it is impossible to improve or it is unwieldy to the user it doesn't matter how good the branding or marketing of that software is. The lipstick runs off very quickly. Whilst in the world of atoms you can put good branding on a can of sugar and fizzy water and see the revenues pour in. In 2024, perhaps more at than at any point in human history, technical competence is the only game in town. The UK is not in a position to compete in that game after sitting out and watching from the sidelines for decades. But that game isn't going anywhere. If you want to participate in the space race, rewire financial transactions, win wars or understand what artifical intelligence is actually capable of you have to play the game. Even commentators aren't immune. Unlike a football game that they can watch with their own eyes the world of bits is in large part not visible to the untrained human eye. Any commentator without technical expertise is commentating on the equivalent of a football game with a blindfold on.

The second domino is transparently owning up to the failures that led to the stark realities of today. No rebirth can happen without a broad understanding and acknowledgement of why your country sunk to the depths in which it finds itself. Whilst it flounders in these absurd narratives on imaginary superiority complexes, virtue signaling and Brexit/EU delusions any potential rebirth has a probability of exactly zero. No sane individual should pin any hopes of a positive future when the state and the media is fiddling as Rome burns. Shimon Peres said "Politics divides, science unites" but politics can do much more harm than that. In the UK it has created an all consuming circus that has pulled in a large subsection of the supposedly brightest minds with the most expensive and privileged education on offer and generated no obvious positive long term returns over a system of chimpanzees pulling levers. Boris Johnson described UK politicians and perhaps all politicians as "crazed wasps in a jam jar each individually convinced that they are going to make it" (Channel 4). How has Israel (so far) not become one giant all consuming jam jar of crazed wasps? Some of the credit surely has to go to leaders like Netanyahu and Peres who saw politics as an unnecessary evil to be minimized rather than something to be obsessed over and celebrated. But also Israel's relative youth means it has a slimmed down Parliament (Knesset) of 120 members rather than the UK's 650 Members of Parliament (MPs) and 792 members in the House of Lords. The massively enlarged jam jar ensures there are ever more ferocious battles over smaller and smaller stakes similar to what Henry Kissinger observed in academia. Any attempts to slim down the jam jar are subject to a swarm of crazed wasps descending in your direction. Crazed wasps who have foolishly spent their lives focusing on politics rather than more productive pursuits that grow the economy and generate wealth rather than merely consume taxpayer money. And crazed wasps that ensure the fat man of the public sector continues to crush the shoulders of the thin man of the private sector to borrow a Netanyahu metaphor.

The third domino is a sustained elevation in standards from everyone from elected representatives to the media. In recent years observing discussions in the UK Parliament has been like watching the inside of a mental asylum. In good times Parliament can afford to only offer (not particularly good) light entertainment with the two major parties making snide jokes and playing a racism version of Punch and Judy trying to portray the opposing party as more "racist" than them. But in bad times when everything seems to be crumbling, the British people are becoming poorer and poorer in real terms (adjusted for consumer price inflation or worse property price inflation) and actual crimes (rather than thought police "crimes") go unpunished Parliament is lurching from dereliction of duty to downright negligence. This can only be solved by replacing existing MPs with MPs of a higher caliber. Whether that is a new party or the Conservative party losing the vast majority of its seats in the 2024 election and starting afresh there needs to be competent individuals in Parliament who want to solve the country's mounting pile of unsolved problems rather than just collect a pay cheque and some generous expenses. But these competent individuals need a subsection of the media to actually cover their efforts to solve problems rather than bombard them with racism Punch and Judy questions. That subsection of the media needs to be free from Ofcom dictates and free from the state that wants to crush aspiration, crush healthy public engagement in politics and keep people trapped in the racism Punch and Judy show. If these three dominoes were set up in a line a UK rebirth might be possible. But whilst they're not and the more time that goes on while they're not the grandparent in the care home is getting older, more frail and increasingly divorced from reality. The US takes on the role of the UK and Israel takes on the role of the US whilst the UK becomes a mere footnote in American and Israeli history books.

## Devolution and the DeSantis premium

Brexit and leaving the EU broadly (though not perfectly) returned sovereignty and democratic accountability back to the UK. Like any freedom or gift bestowed on you that doesn't guarantee better outcomes. If you don't take advantage of that freedom or vengefully blame it for all your troubles then it isn't going to enhance your future. That's not an argument for leaving control in the hands of EU bureaucrats though. If your country is in danger of falling into third world status and global irrelevance you need to take as much control over its future trajectory as you can. Then if you fail at least you know it was through your own decision making and actions rather than because you were outsourcing those responsibilities to EU bureaucrats. The same rationale can be applied to devolution although to a weaker extent as voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland sent MPs to Westminster and could impact who the ruling parties and Prime Minister were prior to devolution. Devolution merely let them operate similar to how individual states do in the United States of America minimizing the dependence on federal government and allowing them the freedom to compete with eachother within bounds set by the federal government. In 2024 devolution in the UK seems like an absolute disaster. Scotland has spent most of the last decade trying to break up the UK as its citizens get more and more impoverished. The more powers given to the Scottish Parliament the more it has blamed Westminster. As it has gained responsibilities over its own fate it has increasingly sought to portray itself as a helpless victim. The Scottish Parliament building cost over 400 million pounds and the SNP (Scottish National Party), the ruling party in Scotland, has been mired in scandal after scandal with the ex leader (Nicola Sturgeon), ex leader's husband and ex Treasurer all arrested amidst financial irregularities. Rather than arguing against Covid lockdowns it argued for even more extended Covid lockdowns as if the economic consequences could then conveniently also be blamed on Westminster. You couldn't write a stronger cautionary tale on the dangers of devolution if you tried.

Why does it work in the United States and has so far been such a disaster in the UK? The United States still has its failures obviously but during Covid it could point to states such as Florida and Texas which took a very different course to the course the federal government was recommending and ended up doing much better economically than they would have done if they'd been entrapped by federal government dictates. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, became a household name during Covid keeping Florida open, overseeing an economic boom and enticing US citizens from all over the country to move to Florida, build businesses and bolster public services such as the police force. The UK didn't have a Florida and didn't have a Ron DeSantis during Covid and it doesn't look as if it will be getting one anytime soon. Part of it is a numbers game. The US has 50 states and the UK effectively has four (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland). This makes it less likely you'll see the outlier success stories. The US has also been the main beneficiary of the brain drain from the UK in recent decades and so it is questionable whether the UK has access to any politicians with the qualities of DeSantis. Post Covid I thought it would be hard for DeSantis to continue the momentum of showing the rest of the nation what was possible with strong conservative leadership but he hasn't slowed down. With Presidential like presentation he has announced legislation upon legislation on trade deregulation, education, law and order, squatters' rights and even deploying Florida soldiers to police the US border with Mexico. DeSantis has achieved this even with an adversarial federal government directly opposing his policies. It comes with the cost that a different state could perform appallingly and even worse than it would have done if it had just followed the federal government's instructions but in theory that state could eventually see the error of its ways with economic underperformance and outward migration and reverse course. Unfortunately the UK thus far has seen all the downsides of devolution with none of the upsides.

State education has this perennial problem that the majority of teachers are left wing. If you believe in capitalism, competition and a diverse meritocracy where enterprising, hard working and lucky individuals are financially rewarded for their efforts placing your child in a state education system almost certainly won't teach them those values. Teachers aren't particularly well paid (though they have long summer vacations), the better performing ones aren't financially rewarded for overperformance and the system doesn't really care whether they exit a particular school or the profession entirely hence the only leverage teachers really have over salary negotiations is by joining unions, threatening to close down schools and disrupting their students' educations. In recent times that problem has worsened as the left wing has morphed into additionally believing in critical race theory, gender fluidity and children making permanent decisions over their bodies pre adulthood. Parental decision making over education for their children was always important as they end up spending more time in classes with their teachers than with their parents. But in recent times it has become ever more critical. Make the wrong decision and not only might your child come back with a hatred of capitalism but they might be encouraged by their teacher to embark on life altering surgery to transition to the opposite gender with the SNP in Scotland threatening prison for the parents if they try to prevent it. This is providing worse outcomes to children than ditching the state education system entirely. The medical adage "first do no harm" is just another long term principle that the left wing is throwing out as it becomes ever more deranged.

It is easy to feel helpless as a parent faced with these threats. If you aren't blessed financially, have a full time job or worse multiple jobs, limited choice on which school your child can attend and no choice over the teachers allocated to your child what can you do? On top of that the state can throw you in prison for wanting to protect your child. This is where the DeSantis premium of living in Florida kicks in. Education reform has been a key pillar of the DeSantis administration. In 2021 he signed a bill preventing transgender females from playing womens' sports as the rest of the Western world seemingly sinks into allowing males transitioning to females to beat up biological females in boxing rings. He prohibited higher education institutions from allocating funding to support critical race theory and directed universities to report the numbers of students who were being prescribed permanent gender transitioning medical treatment. In 2022 he passed the Parental Rights in Education Act giving parents more control over what their children learned at school as always derided by the media who labelled it the "Don't Say Gay" bill. This included prohibiting classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through 3rd grade with school districts required to notify parents if there is a change in services regarding a child's mental, emotional or physical health or well-being. On top of that in 2023 he signed legislation raising total teachers' pay by 1 billion dollars with the average starting teacher salary raised to 48,000 dollars. As the Florida economy has boomed DeSantis has sought to reward and incentivize teachers while also extricating unions from basking in that capitalistic glow. DeSantis is an exceptional politician and leader but without freedom from the federal government he would have been unable to achieve what he has. Does that make up for other states imposing SNP like policies imprisoning parents trying to protect their kids? I don't know. But when the equivalent of your federal government is the SNP it is the only way hope for a better future isn't snuffed out entirely.

## Bitcoin routing around the UK

There are many, many reasons the UK state is allergic to Bitcoin. Some of those reasons overlap with the explanations for the UK not participating or succeeding in the internet revolution and outsourcing technology expertise to the US. But there are additional reasons that are Bitcoin specific. The financial system before Bitcoin which we'll refer to perhaps prematurely as the legacy financial system relied heavily on points of centrality. London and New York were the primary financial centers, currency was issued and monetary policy was set by the central banks (Bank of England and Federal Reserve in the UK and US respectively) and regulatory agencies decided who could be banks and how those banks could operate. If you sit squarely in the middle of one of those points of centrality and derive your power and/or wealth by doing so Bitcoin is a nightmare. Here's something you know nothing about, with a monetary policy you can't manipulate, with holders able to secure their wealth outside of the banking system, with transactions that you can't prevent or cancel, with information on those transactions flowing around a global network outside of your control and with upstarts like El Salvador ahead of you in accumulating Bitcoin on its balance sheet. You'd feel sorry for them if they hadn't been inflating poor people's cash savings away for a decade and pumping up the asset prices of the super rich.

Returning to the UK from California in 2017 with debts, having failed to raise funds for a Bitcoin startup and more importantly having failed to obtain permanent access to the US was the lowest point of my life. At previous low points I had hope for the future and so it was just a case of dusting myself down and aiming bigger. In 2017 I had no hope. I'd spent most of my time in California sleeping in office space, a car and sometimes outside just so I could stay in the Silicon Valley ecosystem, where the Bitcoin developer meetups were, where the smart and ambitious people were, where the best universities were, where the investors in all the technology companies were, where the hope and aspiration were. Although I did everything I could to succeed with the startup, failures happen in the startup world. I was mentally prepared for needing to either pivot the startup or begin afresh but access to California was the lifeline. Without that I was struggling to set deadlines to stay alive by. I'd set a date where if I wasn't able to find some hope somewhere, something to work towards, someone to collaborate with or a romantic relationship I'd commit suicide. Suicide takes guts, it is a leap into the unknown that there's no coming back from. For every deadline that passed without doing it the more weak and useless I felt. If I couldn't even keep my word to myself why should anyone believe I would keep my word to them? I suspect suicide is a deeply personal thing and I don't think I should go further into the details lest I accelerate someone else's fall into the abyss. There weren't thoughts of anger or seeking revenge or anything like that. I was just convinced I had reached the end of the line.

Sheepishly I set up a Bitcoin developer meetup in London in 2018. I didn't expect anything, I knew there were very few Bitcoin developers in London or the UK and I knew that it would be a pale imitation of what I was used to in California. Most of the meetups were very poorly attended in the single figures though when there was an annual international conference in town there would be speakers from the US and outside the UK and much larger attendances. Simultaneously I started diving deeper into the protocol, the reference implementation (Bitcoin Core), Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), completing transcripts of presentations by Bitcoin developers I could find online, contributing to online Q&As on Bitcoin StackExchange and writing emails to the Bitcoin developer mailing list. I couldn't get funding for anything I was doing including the meetup but I assumed eventually I would. More and more developers were aware of me, no one seemed to dislike me and the small number of individuals allocating funding were also aware of what I was doing. In the meantime I did bar work and waiting restaurants in busy periods such as the run up to Christmas to obtain some kind of income. Then came the Covid lockdowns and the coordination of a global upgrade (Taproot) to the Bitcoin network from a bedroom of my parents' house.

I was very wary getting involved with it in the first place. The previous upgrade (SegWit) had been activated in the middle of a two year long block size war and a manic battle over Bitcoin's consensus rules that I had done everything in my power to steer clear from. Like in any war nuance or subtle technical arguments were thrown out the window and the vocal participants on everything from the code repository (GitHub) to social media (Twitter, Reddit etc) seemed to be getting ever more frenzied and deranged. Even though one side ultimately won ensuring blocks of transactions were kept relatively small there were individuals and factions even within the winning side who were at loggerheads on what should have been done or what shouldn't and whether certain threats or actions were justified. Although things had calmed down in the four years since and the losing side had effectively been cordoned off into an alternative currency (Bitcoin Cash) digging up the trauma and the animosity within the factions on the winning side was going to be painful and potentially time consuming. Even in Covid lockdowns I wasn't prepared to spend 2 years batting away swarms of abuse on social media for siding with one faction or another. I also knew that by descending into the hornets' nest and attempting to come out of it with a successful activation of an upgrade wasn't going to be cost free. It was inevitable I would end up upsetting some developers I had essentially been seeking to cultivate working relationships with. It was also very possible that if things turned ugly I'd become unfundable because the best way to get funding is to upset as few people as possible. But no one was picking it up. An upgrade designed and implemented by some of the people I'd essentially idolized in Silicon Valley was sitting there waiting to be activated and the longer it went without someone trying to activate it the greater the risk it would end up going stale and potentially never making it into a Bitcoin upgrade. So I picked it up in collaboration with a couple of other developers with the rationale that I'd try, I'd spend a couple of months on it and if I wasn't able to make any progress or it was descending back into a digital war like scenario I'd back out. What I didn't envisage was that I'd be successful in activating it, I would garner zero (or negative) credit for doing so, I wouldn't get funding and I'd be dragged back into new upgrade activation battles soon after that successful activation. I was shocked but perhaps this is what life is like for the Thatchers and Netanyahus. You can deliver what you set out to achieve, you can deliver what your community or constituency wants, you can gamble huge amounts of time and reputation for no obvious personal upside with zero financial compensation and you can be left on the scrapheap afterwards. If nothing else it made me want to highlight the efforts of and defend those who do the same. Because the world can be a hideously ungrateful and cold place.

The Taproot upgrade activated with only a minor hitch in November 2021. Practically all the complexity was in interacting with and marshalling humans who in the Bitcoin ecosystem tend to be higher on the autistic spectrum rather than any particular technical complexity. There were inevitable disagreements. Getting a group of people to agree on anything is difficult let alone a global community and pseudonyms you've never met or interacted with before. Any progress towards consensus could be punctured at any time by a single individual with a valid criticism, a concern for what could go wrong or merely a desire for attention. Move too fast and you're not giving the community the opportunity to review and participate in the discussion. Move too slow and you're deliberately drawing the discussion out for selfish or foolish reasons. The more progress that was made towards finalization the more individuals wanted to be associated with the discussion often without reviewing any of the previous discussion from recent weeks and months. The closer to the end the louder the calls for starting afresh and effectively throwing away the months of effort I and others had put in to get this far. I was definitely on edge for a lot of it. I was doing pretty much everything in public and it became obvious others were trying to push the discussion in different directions from the shadows and ignoring the public discussion. But I had individuals I could choose to lean on who had been involved with Bitcoin longer than I had, were much better programmers than I was and had been involved in prior activations. After Taproot had activated and what should have been my opportunity to go back to more interesting technical things I instead was battling seemingly alone to ensure the Taproot activation didn't open the door to new upgrades that could have set Bitcoin on a course that would have been much worse than if Taproot had never activated.

In early 2022 I was out of lockdown and out of my parents' spare bedroom. A Bitcoin developer was clamoring to get a new upgrade (CheckTemplateVerify) activated even though this upgrade, unlike the Taproot upgrade, was contentious. This effectively results in a similar situation to the block size war where one side wants to force through a upgrade whilst another side wants to prevent it. Attempting this months after the Taproot upgrade was absurd. Taproot had been a decade in the making, had taken a year to activate and if this new upgrade wasn't contentious it should have just been merged in with the Taproot upgrade rather than attempting two activations in quick succession. Others knew this, in some cases much better than I did, but similar to the Taproot activation they didn't want to become embroiled in another block size war. Hence I was doing my best to explain why it shouldn't happen, I was encouraging others to also explain this and I was speculating what could be learned from the block size war to prevent another war or in a worst case scenario what software could be run to ensure the activation attempt failed. Again all in public knowing that anything I said or any mistake I made would be carved in internet stone potentially for the rest of my life or longer. This wasn't my expertise at all although with a mathematical training and an earlier obsession with risk perhaps I was no less suited to the task than anyone else. The Bitcoin developer threatened to release software for an imminent activation attempt but at the last minute did not do so. To what extent this was due to my efforts I don't know. No one else publicly seemed to be taking it as seriously as I was. Not only would it have been a suboptimal addition to Bitcoin's consensus rules that it has to maintain for the rest of its lifetime and potentially another currency split like we saw with Bitcoin Cash it also would have opened the door to any number of new upgrades this particular developer thought should be added without getting community consensus first. Without agreement on Bitcoin's consensus rules or indeed any lack of certainty on what Bitcoin's consensus rules are Bitcoin can't function. If the network can't agree whether a transaction is valid or not it also can't agree on how many Bitcoin a particular address holds. Hence the bar on what upgrades are attempted has to be as high as you plausibly can make it. Otherwise Bitcoin is entering a game of Russian roulette with every bullet representing a new currency split.

What does all this have to do with the UK? If Bitcoin is routing around the UK and making the UK's financial system slowly obsolescent not much. In 6 years I was able to achieve very little in terms of building any kind of Bitcoin ecosystem from scratch. Of course I sacrificed vast swathes of time to do the cliched "right thing" for Bitcoin but as a one man band I wasn't going to achieve anything anyway. Post the activation struggles I was no longer being invited to Bitcoin Core in person meetings, I had a speaking slot cancelled at a Bitcoin conference, the primary Bitcoin development publication (Bitcoin Optech) stopped covering any of my work and popular Bitcoin podcasts wouldn't have me on. I had no reach in the global Bitcoin community let alone an ability to promote Bitcoin or Bitcoin opportunities within the UK. There were two kinds of people that did very well. In the developer community individuals who met the "diversity" requirements, were young, easily moulded and easily controlled were given everything: funding, work space, media reach, access to the most experienced developers and the freedom to do all their learning in private under the tutellage of those developers. Whilst I and some others tried to document everything we learned on public forums such as Bitcoin StackExchange these individuals left no learning trail whatsoever. It was if they had woken up one day and just uploaded the brains of those experienced developers. And no this is not possible in 2024 for the AGI science fiction writers. To state the obvious this was no longer a meritocracy although it initially started out that way. If you have near 24/7 access to the experienced developers, are allocated viable projects by those experienced developers, don't have to worry about funding, can hoard information and are on all the private chats you are not at the same starting line as someone who struggles to identify a viable project to work on, can't get those experienced developers to answer your questions, can't get funding and so has to do paid work outside of Bitcoin, seeks to publicly share any information you can get your hands on and are excluded from the private chats. Outside the developer community you had these individuals who came from nowhere, knew next to nothing about Bitcoin and would spout absolute nonsense but yet they'd get repeatedly invited to speak at all the conferences and all the podcasts. Some of them were wealthy which makes sense. Wealth attracts fawners for obvious reasons regardless of how that wealth was generated. But some weren't. I assume they were well connected with influential families or the mafia or something and perhaps the conventional media outside of Bitcoin works the same way. But after the first 5-6 years of Bitcoin's history when there was a meritocracy and anyone who showed up to a forum or the GitHub repository was treated the same as anyone else the meritocracy started crumbling. Unfortunately I missed those early years and hence in retrospect was fighting a losing battle from the start.

But there is enough out there publicly to start a company and try to create your own mini meritocracy from scratch. Large parts of the code are open source especially regarding the protocol which is much better than say Windows, MacOS, the Apple AppStore, the Twitter algorithm or the YouTube algorithm. You can't do it in the UK with the state seeking to squash any potential business model and any attempt to onboard users. But moving to or between expat communities is definitely a possibility and El Salvador seems to be the best candidate given the President, Nayib Bukele, has made Bitcoin legal tender and is seeking to build a Bitcoin ecosystem and support Bitcoin businesses. He has even introduced education initiatives so that El Salvador citizens can learn how Bitcoin works and encourage usage, the polar opposite to the approach in the UK which for a decade has misinformed and demonized Bitcoin in the media. Whilst small nation states like El Salvador and Israel persist and don't cave to the forces destroying large parts of the West there is still hope on this planet. But you have to go looking for it, it won't come to you.

## Securing the Bitcoin foundation (2009-2017)

I only really got to observe the final years of the foundational Bitcoin years between 2009-2017. Of course there were decades of work and technical breakthroughs in fields such as cryptography and distributed systems prior to Bitcoin's release in 2009 and Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto was himself standing on the shoulders of giants. But with Satoshi exiting public involvement in Bitcoin in 2010 the task of securing Bitcoin's foundation was left to some of the smartest individuals I've met in my life and some of the smartest individuals I believe exist on the planet. For someone who had wallowed in the British state education system doing the bare minimum and still excelling by its own metrics the opportunity to observe some of these individuals and occasionally interacting with them was exhilarating. These were effectively Bitcoin's founding fathers and hopefully once Bitcoin's foundation is no longer at risk of being blown apart by consensus rule wars their efforts will be adequately documented and recognized. The block size war of 2015-2017 and the drive towards "diversity" ended this era although chinks of new consensus rule wars will unfortunately still present themselves in future. I'm not sure what lessons there are for say countries or aspiring businesses. Bitcoin's emergence has been unique and is unlikely to be repeated in our lifetimes. As a protocol and a consensus system that the entire network has to come to agreement on it is a totally different animal to say a business that can fail without posing existential risks to a country or the planet as a whole. There are similarities to internet protocols and I also see parallels with foundation building in a relatively new nation state like Israel. A nation state can't have multiple competing legal systems, parliaments or leaders. It can devolve some local decision making powers to smaller subentities but when it comes to is this nation state at war or not, what the borders of this nation state are and which justice system is recognized as the ultimate authority a monopoly is the only possible solution to stave off chaos. Maybe when I'm older and I've managed to turn my life around I'll look back with pride that I played a part in getting an important Bitcoin upgrade activated during Covid lockdowns without it descending into chaos afterwards. But it isn't what I set out to do from my suicidal post California slump in 2017 and it certainly wasn't without personal sacrifice.

## Building other neutral, open source, censorship resistant base layers

Unfortuately other online platforms like video sharing (e.g. YouTube), search engines (e.g. Google), email (e.g. Gmail), social media (e.g. X, formerly Twitter), e-commerce (e.g. Amazon) and maps (e.g. Google Maps) don't share the same properties as Bitcoin's base layer. Bitcoin is open source, neutral and censorship resistant. While videos are taken down from YouTube and YouTube channels can be suspended or hidden from search results no one can steal your Bitcoin, no one can prevent your address from receiving Bitcoin and no one can stop your Bitcoin full node being discovered by other Bitcoin full nodes. The media has always tried to influence say election results. The newspaper in the UK, The Sun, famously published the front page headline in 1992 "If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?" with Kinnock's face in a light bulb. However that was nothing in comparison to what online platforms can do today. From their offices in California they can target specific individual floating voters with videos, articles or information personalized to cater to their fears or biases on election day. In the run up to the 2020 US election Twitter prevented Twitter users from sharing a New York Post article on Hunter Biden, President Biden's son, in supposedly private direct messages. Doing that for a US election is one thing, doing that for a foreign election is quite another. No serious independent country or democracy should want it subverted by the politics of California. But at least publicly no one seems to be doing anything. No one is demanding search algorithms are published or made open source and no one is demanding accountability, transparency and due process when say a YouTube channel is suspended or has its discoverability strangled. These platforms are rigged games and no one seems willing or capable to do anything about it. When before you'd go to a shop and decide whether you wanted to buy The Sun newspaper or not, today YouTube is the shop. Given its Californian politics it wouldn't even let you see The Sun as one of the available options which is quite the problem if it has a near monopoly on the shops.

The opportunity is to break open the YouTube and Google monopolies by building an alternative that is open source and transparent at its foundation. For a country like Israel which has been building technical competence in previous decades, has US senators like Chuck Schumer brazenly attempting to manipulate Israeli democracy by calling for new Israeli elections from the Senate floor (March 2024) and politics that generally operates to the right of the US spectrum and Californian spectrum it is a no brainer. Not only is it a commercial opportunity but it is a matter of national importance. Israel is by no means the only democracy that is nervously looking over its shoulder at how YouTube and Google are effectively national infrastructure at this point. Peter Thiel pointed out in 2014 (Zero to One) that Google had a search monopoly and was obscuring it by placing its business in the advertising industry rather than the internet search business. Ten years on nothing has changed other than Google putting its thumb on the scale with seemingly no restraint and much greater force. One response to this would be a Chinese style Great Firewall blocking citizens from accessing certain sites for every nation state that was concerned by this. As a believer in an open internet and free speech with a mistrust of the state I'd much rather see technologists solving these problems by offering the transparency and neutrality that YouTube and Google are unwilling to provide.

Although there are certainly lessons from Bitcoin's evolution on building other neutral, open source, censorship resistant base layers the problem of money has certain characteristics that other platforms don't have. Money requires a consensus system where everyone can ultimately agree on how much money every participant owns. Any monetary system where a subset of the network thinks Individual A owns X whilst another subset of the network thinks Individual A owns Y can't function. If you are a shop and Individual A wants to make a large purchase that costs Z which is greater than X but less than Y you are unsure whether Individual A has enough money to make that purchase or not. With video sharing, search engines, email etc there isn't this same problem. The vast majority of the network doesn't care what videos you own or have created, it doesn't care if one search engine provides different search results to another search engine and it doesn't care if an email between two individuals fails to reach its intended destination and gets returned to sender. Yet you only need one example of the network failing to agree on an individual's balance and that monetary system starts cracking from the inside. Hence other base layers are much more similar to Linux, the open source operating system competing with closed source operating systems like Windows and MacOS, than Bitcoin.

## How to spawn more Linus Torvalds

If I was young today with what I now understand about software and technology I would pick whatever online platform was most exciting to me and learn absolutely everything I could about how that online platform works and try to build a rudimentary open source equivalent that my classmates or fellow students would be willing to use. Mark Zuckerberg initially built a site called FaceMash where you could rate the attractiveness of fellow students. Although you can certainly pick fault with the superficiality of the exercise was this really much different to the dating apps that appeared later like Tinder or Bumble? Without being open source these apps are now charging high fees to use a service where you have no understanding of what is happening under the hood. You have no idea how many people are viewing your profile, you have no idea how many people are rejecting you and for what reason and you have no idea whether what they are asking you to pay for the service is ultimately worth it or not. These companies are asking you to throw money into a black hole with no idea what you are getting in return for it. As a first iteration of dating apps perhaps they were groundbreaking but the user experience could be so much better than it is. For example imagine what data could be surfaced to the user when presented with a new profile. Firstly why are you seeing this profile? Is it because they are nearby, is it because they share interests with you, is it because you are well matched from a physical attractiveness perspective because similar numbers of people are swiping right on both of your profiles? You have no idea. The apps certainly for the less sought after profiles seem to be optimized for endlessly swiping without finding a match and despairingly throwing more coins into the Tinder wishing well. According to Quartz approximately 10 percent of males get 60 percent of all matches which just encourages male promiscuity and females being put off dating because they are treated as disposable by promiscuous men. So why isn't data on how many matches a particular profile gets surfaced to the user? A Warren Buffett like strategy for stock picking is finding companies that are undervalued rather than overvalued by the market. In the dating "market" you have no idea that a certain profile is being overlooked whilst another profile has too many matches than they know what to do with. Because everything under the hood is hidden and these companies are today prioritizing revenue growth rather than user experience vast swathes of their user base aren't getting what they want or could get out of it. New entrants with nothing to lose and a willingness to experiment with much greater levels of transparency and user feedback could very easily create a much better user experience. Why when you get a match and you agree to go on a date with that match are you not provided with recommendations or advertisements on where you could go in the local area and what you could do on that date? Why are the advertisements so useless? Ultimately it is because companies cling to their data and intellectual property and aren't prepared to open up the black box of their software to their users. You have to start small like Zuckerberg did on a college campus and do things that don't scale like Paul Graham suggested to hone the user experience in a tiny market but once you've managed to do that you can expand and end up offering a much better service than the revenue chasing incumbents are doing.

"The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them" Peter Thiel (Zero to One, 2014)

It is certainly possible that the next Linus Torvalds doesn't build an operating system. With Torvalds 54 years old in 2024 and continuing to maintain Linux, an open source operating system run on the majority of web servers and mobile devices, there doesn't seem to be a pressing need for a new open source operating system. Similarly with Bitcoin only 15 years old there isn't a pressing need for a new cryptocurrency and a new Satoshi Nakamoto (although with Satoshi exiting it still requires maintenance). But the early life of Torvalds does provide a template for taking your favorite closed source online platform and building something new with an open source foundation. Like most elite footballers Torvalds started young receiving one of the first ready made computers built for the home (Commodore VIC-20) at 11 years old. In 1981 the only thing you could do with it was program (in the BASIC programming language) and under his grandfather's tutellage that's where he started. He read the manuals and typed in the example programs which included simple games and bad graphics of a man walking across the screen. From this Torvalds started learning how the computer worked under the hood, programming in machine language rather than human readable language and getting "intimate with a machine" (Just For Fun, 2002). At 17 years old he was finding bugs in the operating system he was using and getting frustrated with how its code couldn't be changed, it was read only. As he moved from computer to computer and operating system to operating system it became clear that the sorts of things he wanted to do he couldn't because of the limitations of the operating system he was using. From this frustration he started on Linux which he described in a mailing list email as "just a hobby, won't be big and professional". The snowball had started and given anybody with a passing interest could review his code and suggest changes to it it gathered a momentum that more established and better funded, closed source operating systems couldn't compete with. Why stick with an operating system you can't change and is a black box when there is an operating system that has been designed from the ground up to be tweaked and altered by the user? Why let all your frustrations on how something works fester when there is an alternative world out there where you can build solutions to address those frustrations? The same logic applies to all your favorite online platforms today. The black box is trapping you in a web of bad or suboptimal outcomes.

In the world of atoms and certainly before the internet you would walk round town centers and depending on what you were seeking to purchase enter certain shops. The roads weren't controlled by any particular company and no company could hide the presence of certain physical shops. Compare that to using Amazon today. You visit the Amazon website, search for a particular item using a search algorithm that Amazon controls and isn't inspectable. Amazon controls which roads you go down and if it wants it can not surface details of a particular merchant that might be selling exactly the good you are looking for. This isn't to say Amazon wasn't groundbreaking or still isn't the most convenient way to find and purchase certain items today. But principles that would be unacceptable in the world of atoms (no one American company owns and controls a British town center for example) are the norm today in the world of bits. There is no transparency on what Amazon is doing behind the scenes and things that would be obvious in the world of atoms can be hidden in the world of bits. If you walked round your town center and every shop was a Amazon store at least you'd understand the reality of what was happening in your town center. On the Amazon site certain realities are obfuscated from you. In addition unlike physical shops in a town center Amazon pays very little tax in most of jurisdictions in which it operates and hence isn't operating on the same level playing field as physical shops. Rules that apply to the physical shops don't apply to Amazon. My point is not to suggest the world of bits should be ditched in favor of returning exclusively to the world of atoms although I do think the market is underestimating the role the world of atoms can play complementing the world of bits. My point is that effective national infrastructure being owned by a for profit American company with no transparency or accountability is untenable in the long term. A neutral, open source, censorship resistant base layer could let a fair market and ecosystem thrive on top of it rather than a for profit American company sucking all the value out the marketplace at the base.

## The alternative future that never happened

Perhaps this is always the case with collapsing empires but surveying what could have been is a depressing exercise. There was a time when the UK stood for high levels of technical competence, innovation and showing the world what was possible. I started my professional career in the insurance market based in London within walking distance of Lloyd's of London. Initially set up in a coffee shop in the 1680s Lloyd's of London became the most innovative and exciting place in the world for pairing new sources of capital with insurance risks that conventional insurance companies didn't provide standardized products for. Individuals ("Lloyd's Names") could band together in a Lloyd's syndicate and negotiate the pricing of insurance policies for risks as unconventional and bespoke as maritime voyages, professional sports injuries or a singers' vocal cords. If you had a worry or a concern and wanted to financially protect yourself against the risk of that occurring Lloyd's of London was the first place you'd go on the entire planet. The internet and software presented an incredible opportunity to provide a Lloyd's of London experience to the world through a computer screen but it never happened. Instead the focus was on maintaining a history museum with routines like an individual in gowns hitting the Lutine Bell when a ship sank. Visit the Lloyd's of London website in 2024 and you'll see a timeline of when the first ethnic minorities were introduced and apologies for the slave trade in keeping with today's "diversity" dogma. It didn't have to be like this. The UK had the centuries old foundations to leverage its historic dominance in the world of atoms and build successful businesses and industries in the world of bits. But instead it surrendered to mediocrity, irrelevance and political correctness and it squandered all the work and invention of household names that built its reputation in the first place. With the exception of rare individuals who tried to fight the tide like Churchill and Thatcher the majority of those responsible for throwing away their inheritance and the work of their ancestors were rewarded for their appalling failures with titles, lordships and decorations. As Shimon Peres said "The past is dead, irrelevant. There is only the future". But the cautionary tale from the past doesn't half sting.

A competent, forward looking Lloyd's of London would be all over Bitcoin. Here is a new asset with unique characteristics and unique opportunies that weren't present with previous assets. The price fluctations in fiat terms aren't particularly interesting, every asset goes up and down in price based on market buying and selling although admittedly Bitcoin fluctuations are much more severe than say gold or blue chip stocks. But as an asset native to the internet and a programmable asset secured by digital cryptographic keys the risks and hence opportunities are vast. What device(s) should you store those cryptographic keys on? Can that manufacturer be trusted not to push a firmware update with an exploit in it? Should you use multisignature, a feature Bitcoin enables where the asset is secured by multiple cryptographic keys rather than just one? Who should securely store those keys and be relied upon to generate a digital signature when required? Do you seek to pass on your Bitcoin to your descendants and what particular multisignature scheme should you use so that your Bitcoin aren't stolen while you're alive but your descendants can still access them when you've passed away? There are risk questions all over the place and the Lloyd's of London from centuries ago would be champing at the bit to work out which risks were insurable and how to price those risks. The Lloyd's of London in 2024, crickets. Building competence and expertise in technical fields takes time. Although one can quibble over the exact number of hours required in each field Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hours rule adequately highlights the focus and dedication required to build the deep expertise required. This is nothing new though. Assessing the risks of a maritime voyage a century ago, evaluating which risks could be covered for a certain price and which should be excluded such that all eventualities were understood wasn't an overnight task either. Yet back then people had the dedication and the work ethic to attempt things that hadn't been done before and were financially rewarded for doing so. Today you'd spend years asking for permission from a bunch of overlapping regulatory agencies who had next to no expertise in the risk area you were seeking to expand into and seemingly motivated by the desire to keep all commercial activity within the constraints of their limited spheres of expertise. With this approach Lloyd's of London would have never expanded out of the coffee shop. But Bitcoin is only one example. With the technology  and data available today both applied to the world of atoms as well as the world of bits it is possible to price and ultimately insure risks that wouldn't have been possible decades let alone centuries ago. Every single action or decision in one's life contains risk. Wherever there is risk there is a potential insurance opportunity.  

## Let's assign victimhood status

Of course there are no such apologies on racism or mistreatment of Jews in today's "diversity" dogma and on today's websites. No apologies for excluding Jews from England for three and a half centuries before they were readmitted in 1656. No apologies for excluding Jews from Parliament, local government and universities until the 19th century. No apologies on German websites for confining Jews to particular ghettoes such as the Judengasse in Frankfurt and being barred from entering parks and coffee houses, obliged to wear Jewish insignia by law until 1726. Although the effects of Nazism and the Holocaust still impact the German national psyche today you aren't met by apologies for the Holocaust when you visit a website for a German financial institution in 2024. The "diversity" dogma picks and chooses who it wants to portray as historical victims and who it wants to portray as historical oppressors and what you are left with is an inconsistent sham that the state and the media are determined to perpetuate. And yet from within the high walls of the impoverished Judengasse ghetto in Frankfurt was where the Rothschild banking dynasty emerged in the 18th century. Initially an antiques and coin dealer Mayer Amschel Rothschild only moved into providing banking services in the late 1790s (House of Rothschild, Niall Ferguson). With the British Industrial Revolution beginning to whir overseas demand for the cheaper and higher quality British cloths presented an opportunity for German businessmen like Rothschild to import them and sell them in domestic markets. His son Nathan emigrated to England with some startup capital from his father and established a base there. A natural progression from selling textiles was to offer credit terms to customers and from there Nathan's focus increasingly became this lending part of the business and negotiating with London bankers for access to greater amounts of capital. Both Nathan and his father shifted from being mere merchants to being merchant bankers in a broadly unregulated market. When trying to extrapolate where Bitcoin goes from here in 2024 it seems the 19th century is a much more relevant era of history than the 20th. The gold rush in California and the gold standard used by central banks emerged in the 19th century so if Bitcoin is truly "digital gold" and there is to be an emergence of a digital gold standard knowledge of how a 20th or 21st century financial system operates is almost irrelevant. In 2024 no currencies have been issued linked to Bitcoin and no lending markets denominated in Bitcoin have gained serious traction. With the huge fluctuations in the Bitcoin price today you'd probably need the price to stabilize somewhat so that it behaves like the gold price before a Bitcoin standard could truly emerge. In 2024 we're probably still in the (digital) gold rush part of the life cycle. But where the Nathan Rothschilds emigrate to build banking businesses in this potential new world isn't clear. There would be a certain symmetry if it ended up being Israel and a street off Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv.

"Your life is not f\*\*\*ed up because of overt racists or hidden systemic racism. You aren't missing out on opportunities, making s\*\*\* money and getting evicted because of America or Donald f\*\*\*ing Trump or because your ancestors were slaves or because some people hate immigrants or Jews or harrass women or believe gay people are going to hell. If any of that s\*\*\* is stopping you from excelling in life I've got some news. You are stopping you." David Goggins

What did Nathan Rothschild not do upon showing up in England? He didn't demand that he be given a job at a large business or in government due to his ethnicity and how badly his ancestors had been treated in Germany. He didn't start a "Jewish Lives Matter" organization on the back of a Jew dying abroad guilt tripping businesses into donating to it when they had nothing to do with that individual's death. He didn't demand reparations for Jews being excluded from England for three and a half centuries. In short he didn't perceive himself as a victim and didn't want to project victimhood in his early business dealings. The rot in a country begins when competition over skills, products and services becomes a race to the bottom on who the greater victim is perceived to be. The jury is still out on how effective multicultural societies can be but if one culture is forced to give money and jobs to another culture purely because that culture is assigned victimhood status that multicultural society cannot function and it certainly cannot compete with societies that are focusing entirely on the real competition. Now Jews have a Jewish nation state they have the same option other ethnicities and other religions have always had. If you don't want to be a ethnic minority and compete with the ethnic majority go to a country where you are part of the ethnic majority. Other ethnicities have far more options than the Jews' single option and yet many begrudge the Jews having that option whilst simultaneously taking advantage of victimhood schemes in their new country of residence. 

## Tapping into the David Goggins 40 percent rule

Prioritizing what to focus on in life is arguably the greatest challenge. Rabbi Manis Friedman uses the parable of the man who sets sail to make his fortune only to find himself shipwrecked on an island that is covered in diamonds. On speaking to the locals he learns that the diamonds are perceived as worthless on this island and instead they use scarce onions as currency. Hence he works hard to earn as many onions as he can to earn a living on the island. When he finally leaves the island to return home he loads the ship up with all his onions. On arriving back home his family is disgusted by his cargo of rotting onions. Other than perhaps the parallel of Bitcoin versus inflating fiat currencies the greater parallel is how a cargo of financial wealth is worth nothing after death. Hence our minds or our souls are torn between often competing objectives of succeeding in capitalism and attempting tasks to assist others that don't accrue financial rewards. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates formed The Giving Pledge in 2010 to contribute the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes so that they don't die with a cargo of rotting onions. But I suspect the majority of this allocation was completed decades after their peak of competence when Buffett was building Berkshire Hathaway and Gates was building Microsoft. So did they make a mistake? Should they have spent more time when they were younger allocating capital to philanthropic causes or would that have drastically reduced the success of Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft? Did they spend too much time amassing onions and not enough time amassing diamonds when they were at the peak of their cerebral powers? Were the onions converted into diamonds too late and ultimately wasted? These are tough questions with no easy answers. But whatever currency you are seeking to amass very few reach the levels of performance that Buffett and Gates did and a world with more Buffetts and Gates would surely offer more diamond conversion opportunties. David Goggins hasn't amassed the financial wealth that Buffett and Gates have. His net worth in 2024 according to various sources is in the single millions of dollars rather than the billions. But you certainly couldn't claim his achievements and his impact on the world is a miniscule fraction of various billionaires.

Goggins believes the vast majority of humans today are operating at about 40 percent of their ultimate capabilities. Through studying his mind and its response to being pushed so much further than it was willing to go he found that he was able to complete ultramarathons with all kinds of injuries including at one point a broken leg. Although it probably isn't advisable to go to the lengths that Goggins has he has been able to demonstrate that most of us are leaving a large percentage of our capabilities on the table. We listen to our minds when it says we are at maximum effort when in reality our minds are lying to us. The pursuit of maximizing one's potential never ends and although Goggins is well past his physical peak at approaching 50 years old he still completes ultramarathons and pursues new challenges that people half his age would cower from. He named his second book "Never Finished". With approximately 40 percent of the world's Jewish population residing in Israel in 2024 the project of Jewish revival is far from finished and there is still a large part of Jewish capability left untapped.

## Aliyah and the ascent to Jerusalem

"The message of the Torah is that you never arrive. It is more about the journey than the destination." Rabbi Shlomo Einhorn

Aliyah (עלייה) translates to ascent in Hebrew. It is also the word used for when Jews return to Israel. The Law of Return was passed unanimously by the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, on July 5th 1950 (re-)granting Jews the right to Israeli citizenship. For century upon century Jews have ended the Passover (Pesach) holiday with a wish that "Next year in Jerusalem". A holiday celebrating Jewish households being passed over by a plague prior to Moses leading an exodus from Egypt to the Promised Land. So in 2024 and with Jerusalem back under Jewish control what is stopping "**This** year in Jerusalem" and permanently? Israel's first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion worried that Jews wouldn't return in the formative years of the modern day nation state due to existential wars, a weak military and a lack of basic infrastructure. Although those worries were assuaged during Ben-Gurion's lifetime today the sacrifices required to give up Western safety and comforts are vanishingly small. Israel's missile defense system (Iron Dome and David's Sling) is state of the art. Israel's military (Israel Defense Forces) and intelligence services (Mossad) would be ranked near the top of global rankings. Infrastructure for water, electricity, transport, internet and healthcare is globally competitive. Learning the national language (Hebrew), committing yourself and/or your descendants to military service and accepting a somewhat higher terrorism risk (though vastly reduced from previous decades) would probably be the biggest sticking points. Reading how military service laid the lifestyle foundations for David Goggins and fellow retired US Navy Seal Jocko Willink certainly makes one more amenable to the idea of military service especially when I think back to what I was doing and the time I was wasting at military service age. However, the higher risk of death and/or disability in active military engagements is real especially in the Middle East. Hence those with no ties or connection to their Jewish identity and no desire to participate in the Jewish story may not be convinced.

"G*d has entered into a special relationship or covenant with one people, the Jews or Israel, and given them the task of being a light to the nations" Carl Ehrlich

The opportunity for a nation state roughly 1/500th the size of the US or China with one of the world's smallest yet oldest ethnicities and religions is to be this "light to the nations" especially given how the Torah and the lands of Israel laid the foundations for much more widespread and disseminated religions such as Christianity and Islam. It is understandable that after a long history of pogroms, the Holocaust and Islamic terrorism that the Jewish people would settle for a mere sanctuary but the leaders of the Zionist movement have certainly set their sights higher than that. Whether it be Theodor Herzl's "If you will it, it is no dream", David Ben-Gurion's "In Israel, in order to be a realist, you must believe in miracles" or Shimon Peres' "You're as young as your dreams, not as old as your calendar" the philosophical and spiritual undercurrent has continuously grasped for the impossible even as the real world emergencies mounted up. There is a necessity for outperformance at a small scale because it is the only way to maintain relevance in a world of giants. You also see this dynamic in technology startup ecosystems such as Silicon Valley where crazily ambitious ideas attract talented people much more effectively than merely practical ambitious ideas. Whatever drove it Jewish culture and customs refused to die or wither away in the scattered diaspora despite centuries of persecution and pressure to assimilate. Now it is reassembling under its own roof again it has the chance to demonstrate why it was so important it didn't.

## Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Land)

"When I think of my son's future I ask myself whether I have the right to make life so difficult for him as it has become for me" Theodor Herzl

One of the many miracles in the resurrection of Israel was how despite little precedent to follow and with a multitude of strong opposing views on how to achieve it the essential building blocks of that nation state were assembled and refined such that it is difficult for a mere mortal to find flaws with the end result. Of course this didn't happen in the absence of sustained and near obsessive human endeavor. If history had turned out differently and indeed if an uncertain Herzl had got his way the only Jewish state could today be in Uganda or Argentina rather than the lands of his biblical ancestors. This attempt at a compromise or an intended halfway house would have resulted in a flawed first building block. Without land a nation state is nothing and with the wrong land it would have been difficult to self correct at a later time. The arguments and motivation for a state in the Middle East would have been weakened and the intended halfway house could very well have ended up being the final house and ultimate dead end. Succeed with the ill fated project and there's no need to embark on a follow up project. Fail with the ill fated project and why wouldn't this be harbinger of what would happen in the follow up project? Though Herzl had good intentions and wanted a viable sanctuary from persecution for Jewish people as early as he could achieve it he and his future nation state dodged a bullet by not compromising on that first building block. Despite uncertainty over the exact borders on formation a foothold in Jerusalem was ultimately established and without it Herzl would have at best been assigned to the footnotes of history.         

## Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Language)

"If we wish that the name Israel be not extinguished, then we are in duty bound to create something which may serve as a center for our entire people, like the heart in an organism, from which the blood will stream into all the arteries of the national body and fill it with life." Eliezer Ben-Yehuda

The next building block after determining the lands of the nation state were to assign a language in which its citizens would communicate. The Herzl of the language question was Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. While Herzl didn't think Hebrew would be a viable option given it hadn't been a spoken language for 1,500 years Ben-Yehuda thought otherwise and was determined to revive the biblical language as Israel's national language. This required inventing new Hebrew words for objects such as newspaper and dictionary that hadn't existed 1,500 years prior. For greater legitimacy or merely due to reverence for the past Ben-Yehuda rooted many of these new words in existing Hebrew words. The Hebrew for time (et, עֵת) rooted iton (עִתּוֹן) for newspaper since a newspaper is a time sensitive publication. The Hebrew for word (milah, מִלָה) rooted milon (מִלּוֹן) for dictionary since a dictionary is a collection of words (The 700 Club). Ben-Yehuda himself started a weekly newspaper in Hebrew and completed six volumes of a Hebrew dictionary during his lifetime. In addition to updating the language for the modern day Ben-Yehuda raised the first native speaker of Hebrew in modern times, his son Itamar. At a time when mixing with other children would have meant exposure to languages other than Hebrew Ben-Yehuda kept his son at home so that he would only learn Hebrew words, including words he himself had invented, and would only converse in Hebrew. This led to his son only speaking his first word at the age of four, reportedly the Hebrew word for enough (dey, דֵּי) as his father was berating his mother for singing a lullaby in Russian.

## Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Flag)

"We have no flag, and we need one. If we desire to lead many men, we must raise a symbol above their heads." Theodor Herzl

There was no flag (degel, דֶּגֶל) to inherit from the times before Jerusalem was seized by the Romans two millennia ago and in the centuries since the design and pronouncement of a unique, recognizable flag had become a rite of passage for any new nation state. Herzl himself suggested a white flag with a star in the center but a gold star rather than a blue one. The color of the Star of David (Magen David, מגן דוד) at the center of the Israeli flag was ultimately chosen to be the shade of blue used by the Tallit (טַלִּית), the traditional Jewish prayer shawl. The Star of David itself is made up of two triangles. The triangle's three corners represent the relationship between G\*d, Israel and the Torah with the triangle pointing upwards representing people working for G\*d and the triangle pointing downwards representing G\*d working for the people. The blue stripes at the top and bottom of the flag also mirror those on the Tallit. The second President of the Zionist Organization David Wolffsohn stated "Let us take this Tallit from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations".

## Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Government)

There was a representative assembly 1,500 years ago called the Great Assembly (Knesset Hagedolah, כְּנֶסֶת הַגְּדוֹלָה) with 120 members made up of rabbis and prophets. The government that was formed with the modern day state of Israel inherited the name ("Knesset", כְּנֶסֶת) and the number of representatives (Members of Knesset or MKs) but it also installed selective pillars of 20th century democratic systems seen in the UK, US and Europe. The head of state, the President, is elected by secret ballot in the Knesset but carries out a more ceremonial role than say the US President with similar powers and responsibilities to a British monarch. The executive power is vested in the Prime Minister, the head of government, who is nominated by the President but can only form a government with the support of a majority of MKs. The MKs themselves represent political parties that received a sufficient number of votes in national elections to be represented in the Knesset. In this sense each MK does not represent a particular region of Israel in the same way as British MPs represent a certain constituency in the UK or Senators and Members of Congress represent a certain state or district in the US. With the uncertainty over the exact borders of the nation state on formation and Israel's small size in land mass this representation of political parties rather than regions avoided the inevitable disruption caused by wars and malleable borders without the need to suspend or repeatedly revamp the election process. The proportional representation of Israel's democracy and need to enter into coalitions between political parties to form a government more closely resembles many European systems than the UK's or US' first-past-the-post systems. It is also said that this system allows minority interests to be represented in coalition governments rather than one of two major political parties inevitably forming the next government. With Jewish diaspora returning to Israel over time with very different experiences and perspectives the ability for new political parties to participate and potentially be represented in the Knesset makes the system adaptable to Israel's continuously evolving population.

One inevitable point of contention was the extent to which G\*d and the Jewish religion would be infused into the Jewish state's newly formed Knesset. The precedent from other democratic systems was as Thomas Jefferson put it "building a wall of separation between church and State". The rationale for this separation was to enshrine freedom of religion into the U.S. Constitution and to avoid heated theological debates subsuming the advancement and refinement of the nation's laws and regulations. Indeed Israel's Declaration of Independence (1948) guarantees freedom of religion within the Jewish State noting how Israel contains holy places for religions other than Judaism and a significant Arab population practising a different religion. Ultimately this declaration did not mention G\*d by name at all with some of its signatories and indeed Herzl himself identifying as secular though a reverential reference to the "rock of Israel" did make it into the final document prior to the signatures. Instead like the Israeli flag the religious signatories had to settle for infused imagery with the Menorah being chosen as the emblem of the Knesset and the seating of the plenum hall where Members of Knesset sit being arranged in the shape of a menorah. The Menorah, a seven branch candelabrum, represents the eternal light and presence of G*d as described in the Hebrew Bible. It also resembles a tree with seven branches just as the Torah is referred to as the "Tree of Life" (עץ החיים).

One indisputable flaw with Israel's Declaration of Independence was including the declaration that a constitution would be adopted later in the year (October 1948) only for that objective to be postponed indefinitely in 1950 at least partly due to disagreements at a time of war. To this day Israel has no formal constitution to parallel the U.S. Constitution. Instead it has what is referred to as Basic Laws which some consider the state's constitution although a new Basic Law was introduced as late as 2018 with the Basic Law: Israel - The Nation State of the Jewish People. With no formal constitution, no second chamber like the US Senate or the House of Lords in the UK, no restrictions on striking down laws and limited ability for the elected Knesset to reform or restructure it the Supreme Court in Israel is one of the most powerful Supreme Courts in the world. The Netanyahu government attempted judicial reform in 2023 to restrict the Supreme Court's power to strike down legislation passed by the elected Knesset but as of 2024 the Supreme Court has struck down that particular legislation. This tension between the elected Knesset and the seemingly more powerful, unelected Supreme Court will almost certainly prove to be a continuing growing pain for Israeli democracy without reform bringing it line with other democratic systems. As of 2024 the focus has turned to military action in Gaza and elsewhere but this problem will no doubt rear its head repeatedly in future especially if the Supreme Court continues to strike down legislation intending to rebalance powers back to Israel's democratically elected chamber.

## Resurrecting the building blocks of a nation state (Military)

"Perhaps we are all Aladdins, every novel idea is a kind of magic lamp able to bring forth the creative spirit... till it becomes obsolete. Perhaps herein lies the real achievement of victory when the victor becomes dispensable." Ze'ev Jabotinsky

Every nation state needs an organized, cohesive and united military and Israel critically needed one immediately on conception. No sooner had David Ben-Gurion declared independence and the British Mandate been terminated than the concept of a Jewish state was under attack by surrounding Arab states. Hence somehow Ben-Gurion had to conjure a military into being to defend it overnight which is of course impossible. Instead the ground work was laid in the previous decades to cobble together a fighting force that could unite against a common enemy seeking to asphyxiate it from birth. The Herzl of the defense question was (arguably, in a military context where the focus is less on particular individuals) Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Jabotinsky is considered by many as Herzl's successor in advancing the Zionist cause and the implementer of Herzl's vision. Hence focusing exclusively on his role setting up early defense organizations is ignoring the multitude of contributions elsewhere within the Revisionist Zionism movement he founded and led. One could go further and claim he birthed the right wing political movement in Israel which spawned multiple future Prime Ministers and multiple political parties including the current Prime Minister (Netanyahu) and the current largest political party (Likud). But without resolving the defense question there wouldn't have been a Jewish state to govern so it is not unreasonable to claim this was his most significant achievement.

The constantly shifting geopolitical terrain in the decades preceding Israel's Declaration of Independence in 1948 complicated Jabotinsky's task yet further. Two world wars, a still immensely powerful British Empire that seemed to oscillate from supporting the Zionist cause to opposing it and internal divisions on the optimal path to take with no democratic mandate to resolve those divisions required high levels of both steadfastness and flexibility. At times Jewish battalions in the Jewish Legion were fighting with and sometimes within the British Army such as in World War 1. But when British sentiment turned against Jewish migration and settlement in Israel Jabotinsky and the military organizations he had helped set up held no qualms reversing course and executing a strategy of armed revolt against the British. Facilitating Jewish migration from Nazi Germany in the run up to World War 2 was literally a life or death issue for huge swathes of Jewish people ignoring the ultimate fate of a future Jewish state. Hence unravelling the threads of perfidy between the British and the Jews at this time is complex. It is unquestionable that the diplomatic sands were continuously shifting as power over British foreign policy flowed back and forth from Zionist allies such as Lord Balfour and Sir Winston Churchill to Zionist adversaries such as Neville Chamberlain and the author of the 1939 White Paper restricting Jewish immigration, Malcolm MacDonald. In this climate Jabotinsky had no choice but to follow the John Maynard Keynes maxim "When the facts change I change my mind. What do you do sir?"

That a Jewish Legion was formed at all to hone valuable experience fighting in World War 1 was broadly down to Jabotinsky's diplomatic efforts against resistance from both Zionist leaders and skepticism amongst the British. Jabotinsky himself enlisted as a private before being promoted to lieutenant within the 3 Jewish battalions that became known as "The First Judeans". After being demobilized for what Jabotinsky considered political reasons he settled in Jerusalem in 1920 where he formed the first self defense unit in the country, Ha'haganah (The Defense, הַהֲגָנָה). This endeavor also landed him in trouble with the British authorities as he was arrested during disturbances and condemned to 15 years hard labor, later reduced to 1 year's imprisonment. From this organization more radical offshoots such as Etzel (or Irgun) and Lehi branched off and they sought to drive the British out of Israel during and after World War 2 through much more violent means. Shortly after the Declaration of Independence Ben-Gurion was able to form the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) by merging these at times very different paramilitary organizations into a single national army. Like Herzl before him Jabotinsky did not live to see it, passing away near New York in 1940 whilst campaigning for the creation of a Jewish Army. He was eventually reburied on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem nearby to Herzl himself who he had first defended in a speech at a Zionist Congress in 1903.          

"The IDF is thus the child and successor of the Haganah. The seed that was planted many decades previously in the first settlements, had sprouted into a sturdy oak, struggling hard in order to grow and develop, but finally overcoming all its problems. If the Haganah is the trunk of this tree, then the IDF is the mesh of sturdy branches that sprang from it and drew on its sap - branches that shelter and protect all that grows in their shade throughout the State of Israel." Ha'hagana (Adapted from a Brief History of the Haganah)

## Religious Zionism - Revising Revisionist Zionism?

"A person lacking it (religion) is not a harmonious human being... I am not certain that we shall be able to bring about a revival. Perhaps it is a quality with which one is born, bestowed upon the few, something like musical talent. But if it were possible to create a generation of believers, I would be happy." Ze'ev Jabotinsky

Nothing in the natural world stands still. The world constantly evolves and at the very least one is forced to react to external changes. Leaders like Herzl and Jabotinsky were able to shape the future of Israel and identify its future needs decades previous. Jabotinsky's Revisionist Zionism took Herzl's Zionism and updated it to emphasize the importance of a strong military, of not relying exclusively on diplomacy with often fickle allies, of building a nation state that would eventually attract the entire diaspora and inspire the world through quotes such as "For out of Zion shall go forth the Law" (Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Joseph Nedava). On religion Jabotinsky was admiring though not strictly observant himself. His childhood home was filled with Jewish tradition and his mother Hasidic but he became apathetic to Jewish customs and rituals as he witnessed the way Jews apologetically assimilated into their host countries, accepted their plight in the degradation of slums and adopted "servile humor, which papers over the abasement by belittling the hated tyrant instead of rising up in revolt". He maintained deference to his religion throughout his life though never advocated for religious coercion.

To propel Israel further into the 21st century it could be argued that it is missing the overarching political movements and philosophies that Herzl and Jabotinsky formulated and propagated. One candidate for such a movement would be Religious Zionism. Today it is perhaps most strongly represented by the political parties Religious Zionism led by Bezalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) led by Itamar Ben-Gvir with roots in the ideology of Rabbi Meir Kahane who was assassinated in New York in 1990 by a suspected Islamic terrorist. Kahane was infuriated by the way Jews almost by habit after centuries in the diaspora took their apologism and servile attitude to Israel when they finally had the chance to rebuild their national home. He looked on in horror as Israeli leadership rewarded Islamic terrorism by repeatedly agreeing to give away its biblical heartlands and shrink an already tiny country. With the Americans taking the place of the British as the global hegemon in the second half of the 20th century Israel was pressured to countenance splitting Jerusalem into two and continues to this day to restrict Israeli citizens' access to Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism, as if Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is still a temporary façade. Kahane saw this American approach towards Israel as ultimately hypocritical, kowtowing to violence and Arab financial interests and displaying the same fickleness as the British before them. The Americans would never agree to relinquish southern states to Mexico for example in the hypothetical scenario where Mexico funded and orchestrated a campaign of terror against the US. If anything Kahane saw Israel's historic claims over its lands as stronger than American historic claims over its own lands. During Kahane's lifetime his views were extremely controversial and his Kach political party was banned from participating in the 1988 elections for the Knesset. In 2024 his views seem to have permeated the Israeli mainstream as leaders such as Smotrich and Ben-Gvir gain in popularity and Israeli society seems to have come to the realization that sovereignty within a country's borders is not a granular thing. It is binary. You either have it or you don't.                                              

## The Third Temple - Where the wailing stops

"The mountain of G\*d's house shall be established atop the mountains... all the nations shall flow unto it" Isaiah 2:2

The Western Wall (the Kotel, הַכּוֹתֶל) or Wailing Wall is the wall within the Old City of Jerusalem where Jews pray and mourn the loss of the Second Temple, destroyed during the Roman siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. It is also where slips of paper containing written prayers are placed within the cracks of the wall. The original First Temple had been built by King Solomon, son of King David, in 966 BCE and was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. Since the destruction of the Second Temple Jews have been without a place of worship on their holiest site. The project to restore the Holy Temple hence is much anticipated and artifacts such as a golden Menorah, an altar, musical instruments and priestly garments have already been painstakingly prepared to meet the exact specifications as described in Jewish religious texts. Precise plans have also been drawn up for the various chambers, gates and courtyards (The Holy Temple in Jerusalem, Rabbi Yisrael Ariel). What is holding up the commencement of construction work especially with Jerusalem back under Jewish control is primarily politics and the security situation. Itamar Ben-Gvir has called for Jews to pray on the Temple Mount despite status quo conventions restricting it and has personally visited the site himself on numerous occasions receiving backlash from media outlets, Palestinian groups such as Hamas and Arab states in the region. To what extent he and others in a broader Religious Zionism movement can make this a key pillar of future election campaigns may ultimately determine whether construction of a Third Temple can begin in this generation or whether future generations will be left to pick up the mantle.

"And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them" Exodus 25:8

There is a messianic ethos running through Judaism where preparing for and hastening the coming of Moshiach (מָשִׁיחַ) is a key motivator for keeping commandments (mitzvot, מצוות) and for building a better future. It is such ingrained in Jewish tradition that spiritual leaders implore political leaders to work harder and do more to usher in this age sooner. During his lifetime "The Rebbe" (The Lubavitcher Rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson) met with Netanyahu on multiple occasions repeatedly enquiring why the Moshiach hadn't arrived yet. Many Jews have set aside clothes to wear on the day that this occurs. A common reason used to justify __not__ doing things such as founding and returning to the modern day nation state of Israel or building the Third Temple is that they should only be completed once Moshiach has arrived. This uncertainty and tension over what humans should attempt to accomplish through their own agency and what should be left to G\*d's will is nothing new. The parable of the drowning man portrays the essence of this age-old quandary where a religious man drowning in an ocean refuses to accept assistance offered by multiple boats because he is convinced G\*d will save him. After perishing in the ocean the man asks G\*d why he didn't intervene to which G\*d responds that he had sent the boats who had come to the man's aid. Just as The Star of David has a triangle pointing upwards representing people working for G\*d sometimes the tools for completing a task have been laid in front of man and yet man still waits for G\*d to accomplish it.

## Refocusing on the lodestar

Whatever the level of abstraction, whether it be at the level of the individual, family, community, country or people, it is difficult for them to function let alone thrive without a lodestar. A lodestar is defined as a star used in navigation or astronomy as a point of reference or something that serves as a guide or model (British Dictionary). The Jewish people are blessed (or cursed depending on your perspective) that after two millennia on the run their lodestar is blatantly obvious. The restoration of the Jewish state, the restoration of Jerusalem and ultimately the restoration of the Holy Temple. In contrast it is not clear what the lodestar is for the Christian people or gentiles in 2024. The concern is that certainly the British Empire and maybe even the American one has seen its best days and what follows is just a question over the speed of decline. If one had to choose one would be rather on the slope upwards rather than the slope downwards reminiscing over the good ol' days. But no people would choose to wallow in the wilderness fleeing repeated persecutions and pogroms for two millennia to earn a lodestar. The challenge for the Christian people or gentiles will be to carve out small states like Israel in their old empires with clear lodestars that their people and their descendants are willing to dedicate their lives to and ultimately willing to die for. The alternative if they fail is to have the historical Jewish experience of wandering from place to place for centuries as a persecuted minority and subsumed into Islamic societies and traditions. The irony is that with much of the Western world demonizing Israel it is providing the template for survival and G*d willing the template for thriving in a new world with the old economies of scale breaking down and the world of bits bypassing the world of atoms.

The Hebrew word for sin (חטא) means something akin to a missed opportunity, like an arrow missing its mark (chabad.org). The archery or dart board that presents itself to each generation is different. The board that presented itself to Theodor Herzl was different to the board that presented itself to Ze'ev Jabotinsky as was the board that initially presented itself to Benjamin Netanyahu. A bullseye in Herzl's time represented a different set of objectives and overcoming a different set of challenges to a bullseye in Netanyahu's time. Maimonides ("The Rambam"), the 12th century rabbi who compiled a list of the 613 commandments (mitzvot, מצוות), described the rebuilding of the Holy Temple as a mitzvah that is "binding for all generations". He believed that sacrifices should be offered on the altar there even while the Temple is not built. In recent centuries it is a common belief that each generation in which the Temple isn't rebuilt it is as if that generation destroyed it. Maimonides also stated in his rulings that performing the commandments should not be dependent on the coming of Moshiach (מָשִׁיחַ) and that they should be performed to the best of abilities under all conditions. The coming of Moshiach is left to G*d but earthly commandments are within man's purview.

## Yes we Kahane

"You need this land and it needs you, many of you. Millions of new Jews pouring into Israel will fill up its empty spaces, guarantee the retention of all the liberated lands of Judea, Samaria, Golan, Gaza, and Sinai; assure a vast Jewish majority despite the addition of a million new non-Jews; add Western democratic and technical skills to the land. Eretz Yisrael will never again be lost to us." Rabbi Meir Kahane

In the world of bits bits have been known to have flipped due to reasons as obscure as cosmic rays. Through no fault of the engineers of the software or the hardware it is possible (though admittedly highly unlikely) that data can be corrupted or servers can crash due to this reason. It highlights why the lower the level engineers are operating at the more fastidious they need to be as the tiniest, most minute error can be devastating. It is difficult to maximize one's fastidiousness if one is regularly distracted or worse dodging bullets and rockets. In the world of atoms rebuilding the Third Temple requires similar levels of fastidiousness if one is to follow the exact specifications as described in Jewish religious texts. Whether it be a perfectly unblemished, ritually pure red heifer or an altar built to match the dimensions of the altar built by Moses in the desert they seem to test the limits of human fastidiousness. The environment in which it is possible to achieve this can only be created by the militarial and security efforts nominally led by Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir. It doesn't matter how unblemished your red heifer is if it can be bombed by a terrorist or if the Temple Mount can be flattened by a nuclear bomb at any moment. With regards to the Third Temple it seems that Netanyahu will ultimately be judged on how he dealt with the nuclear threat and Ben-Gvir to what he extent he was able to secure the Temple Mount to create the conditions in which rebuilding the Third Temple became possible. Meanwhile the words of Rabbi Meir Kahane live on decades after his death imploring Israel's leaders to address Israel's security challenges and enforce its sovereignty over its lands.

"The Moslems and the mosques shall be removed from the holiest site in Judaism, the Temple Mount, and the disgrace of desecration of Judaism ended. Consider the reaction of Moslems - and rightly so - to a Jewish synagogue on the holy Moslem site in Mecca! And yet Jews sit and enforce the abomination of Moslem rule and prohibition of Jewish presence on the Temple Mount!" Rabbi Meir Kahane

The accusation of racism was weaponized against Kahane during his lifetime. His Kach political party was banned in 1988 under revised election laws related to the incitement of racism and he suffered a similar fate to those "canceled" in recent times unable to appear on mainstream television programs with his press conferences and statements not reported on by the Israeli media. Baking a blatant asymmetry into the "status quo" where other races and faiths were treated as dominant and superior to Kahane's Judaism in the supposedly only Jewish state incensed Kahane. To Kahane the "status quo" that restricted Jews' rights to access and pray on the Temple Mount was symbolic of the bankruptcy of Jewish leadership that was willing to trade and compromise away some of the most cherished aspects of the Zionist dream for political and diplomatic convenience. He was highlighting blatant absurdities decades before it was acceptable to in mainstream Israeli politics. Today Kahanists like Ben-Gvir have broken through and seem to have sufficient escape velocity so as not to suppressed and put back in the bottle by an at times self interested and directionless Jewish establishment. Whether individuals like Ben-Gvir have the courage of Kahane and are willing to keep pushing against the hypocrisies and asymmetries at possible personal cost politically will determine whether the flywheel started by Kahane maintains its momentum or stalls. Kahane paid the ultimate price with his life and in this game of high stakes poker political fortunes can certainly be won or lost.

"I've made my living Mr Thompson in large part as a gambler. Some days I make twenty bets. Some days I make none. There are weeks, sometimes months in fact, when I don't make a bet at all because there simply is no play. So I wait. Plan. Marshall my resources. And when I finally see an opportunity and there is a bet to make? I bet it all." Arnold Rothstein character in Boardwalk Empire (HBO)

There will come a time, perhaps in the run up to an election season, when Ben-Gvir will be faced with two options. Stick rigidly to his Kahanist belief system which ultimately is just a Torah based belief system, Kahane was "totally immersed in Torah during his lifetime" and his "strength derived from this" (Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu, former Chief Rabbi of Israel). Or water it down and compromise on it in an attempt to gain votes and become more palatable to an international audience. Kahane was clear in his belief that Israel should be set apart from the rest of the nations, a principle established in the verse "It is a nation dwelling alone" (Num 23:9). He believed that G\*d wished Israel to be set apart from the non-Jew and wished the land to be free of their influence. In addition Kahane considered living in Israel as a mitzvah commanded by the Torah itself and indeed a mitzvah that carried equal weight to all the other mitzvot combined. An Israel controlled by Jews in the diaspora who refused to live in Israel and follow this critical commandment was also an anathema to him. This would be a significant step change from the status quo. Netanyahu, arguably wisely during his time, was and continues to be strongly oriented towards the United States like most other Western allies in the 20th and 21st century. But under Democratic leadership American meddling in Israeli affairs to the detriment of Israeli military objectives has led Ben-Gvir to state "I really admire the United States of America but with all due respect we are not another star in the American flag". The Israel that Kahane envisaged, and one suspects the Israel that Ben-Gvir would like to mold has little room for compromise and watering down whether it be land, sovereignty or ultimately progress towards a Third Temple. At some point Ben-Gvir will inevitably have to decide whether he's all in on this vision for Israel or whether he too will need to make concessions based on the perceived political realities of the time.                 

## The sounding of the Trump(ets) at the cusp of a new generational dawn

The Lord spoke further to Moses, saying “Make yourself two trumpets of silver, of hammered work you shall make them; and you shall use them for summoning the congregation and for having the camps set out." Numbers 10:1-2

Trumpets were used in the First and Second Temple periods to usher in a new day and on the opening of the Temple gates. They are among the musical instruments on display at the Temple Institute in Jerusalem. Priests from the Mikdash Youth practise with Temple era trumpets as part of their training for the Tamid sacrificial offering and candle lighting in a future Third Temple. The golden Menorah standing today opposite the site of the Holy Temple was installed to the sound of silver trumpets just as Moses was instructed to make silver trumpets in biblical times. As I write this (November 2024) Donald Trump has fought back against widespread online censorship, lawfare conducted by his political opponents and assassination attempts to regain the US Presidency winning the popular vote for the Republicans for the first time in two decades. The inbox he faces as he prepares to be sworn in as the 47th President in January 2025 is the most daunting and lengthy of any new President since the Great Depression and World War 2. Whether it is domestically or internationally where a new global order seems to be on the horizon Trump's next term has the potential to be a critical turning point in world history. Four years is not a long time in the grand scheme of things and in the absence of a Franklin D Roosevelt style third term you'd expect Trump would settle for a domestic focused legacy potentially taking his place on Mount Rushmore next to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. With regards to Israel Trump already has a legacy from his first term of moving the American embassy to Jerusalem recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital, of recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and normalizing Israeli relations with surrounding Arab states in the Abraham Accords. There is a new settlement, Trump Heights, named after him in the Golan Heights. What more could Trump do, and indeed should Trump do with an Israel seeking less reliance on the United States, in his second term? The glaring issue which you suspect Israel would be unable to deal with on its own, and the issue which overlaps with Netanyahu's own legacy, is the nuclear threat from Iran. An Iran armed with a nuclear bomb would be unacceptable to both Israel and a Trump led United States and hence is expected to be the top priority of any second term Israel policy. There could very well be additional lands recognized by the United States as Israeli territory in Gaza, Judea and Samaria. A dark horse addition to the Trump legacy before he ends his second term, especially if he has his eye on etching his name on history measured in the millennia rather than the merely the centuries, would be to signal his support for the rebuilding of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. There is a path, though challenging and fraught with some risk, for a newly elected President Trump to sound the trumpet on the biggest real estate development of all time.

"In a Torah sense we have to leave the behavior pattern of Jacob, which is more a kind of tricky, clever, knowing how to balance things, knowing how to say the right things at the right moment; with Israel, which is straight, clear policy.... That makes for good deals, that makes for good policy." Yishai Fleisher

Certain instances in history present a generational opportunity for a step change and a turning point to pivot towards the optimal path. After 12 years out of the last 16 years battling an Obama directed foreign policy that was mistrustful of Israel, seeking to constrain it and where possible sideline it in the Middle East you would forgive a 75 year old Netanyahu for struggling to complete the near instant 180 degree turn that the moment requires. A transactional, deal oriented President Trump nearly four decades on from writing "The Art of the Deal" who clearly from his first term envisages a brighter future for Israel than his predecessors at the start of what is expected to be his last term presents that opportunity for a generational turning point if such a moment ever exists.

## One Jewish state: The final solution

"And if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those that you let remain of them shall be thorns in your eyes and thistles in your sides and shall torment you in the land wherein you dwell." Numbers 33:55

The sticking point today and in Kahane's time complicating the exertion of full Israeli sovereignty over Gaza, Judea and Samaria is and has been the presence of millions of Arab, Muslim inhabitants, many of which do not want to live in the world's only Jewish state to the extent that they support terrorism and the indiscriminate killing of Jewish Israelis in an attempt to destroy the Jewish state from within. It is blatantly obvious that these inhabitants should not be residing in the Jewish state and allowing them to remain is an act of seemingly intentional self harm. Empathy is a noble trait but it has its limits before it starts to become suicidal. You may invite a downtrodden individual into your home as an act of goodwill but if you allow them to remain in your home after they attempt to kill your wife and rape your daughter then the responsibility for what happens next is entirely yours. Where should they go? There are a minimum of 19 nation states with Arab majorities who if they had a modicum of affinity and compassion for their fellow Arab would offer citizenship to those who wanted to live in a majority Arab and/or majority Muslim country. The fact that they haven't thus far offered this option is a reflection of these countries using Arab populations residing in Israel as a stategic weapon to undermine the Jewish state and/or a reflection of the Arab citizens within Israel being perceived as troublesome no matter what country they reside in. In the absence of any of these Arab majority nation states offering citizenship pathways to their fellow Arab like Israel offers citizenship pathways to fellow Jews they will need to be deported to a country that Israel enters a deal with just as the UK partnered with Rwanda for the UK-Rwanda Migration and Economic Development Partnership (2022).

A common criticism of this security first approach that takes protecting Israel's Jewish citizens from Arab terrorists seriously is that it resembles Hitler's treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. After suffering from Nazi persecution and ultimately the Holocaust are the Jews carrying out their own Holocaust on the Arab population within Israel? To risk sounding trite has the hunted become the hunter? I think it is a valuable question to keep in mind as Israel guards the ethics on which it judges itself but the comparison breaks down under even the slightest pressure. Hitler was seeking a genetic and ideological purity that had no place for a single Jew of any religious or political persuasion either within Nazi Germany or his designs for the European continent. This was driven by a visceral hatred of Jews and a belief that though small in number they were succeeding in bringing about the destruction of his country through non-violent means. Kahane and his ideological progeny today do not hate Arabs, nor are they seeking to "purify" Israel of Arabs let alone the entire Middle East. There are Israeli Arabs serving today in the Israel Defense Forces, Israeli Arab parliamentary members of the Knesset and Israeli Arabs representing the national football team. There has been and will be no Israeli parallel of Hitler looking down disdainfully at Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Olympics for bringing Aryan supremacy into disrepute. There is a place in Israeli society for a peaceful Arab minority who will pledge allegiance to a Jewish state and serve the best interests of that Jewish state. However, there is no place in the Jewish state for any Arab who seeks to undermine, breakup or ultimately destroy the Jewish state in which they reside. That approach historically aligns with every other nascent Western nation state. A security first approach rather than a suicidal empathy approach means prioritizing the safety of Jewish citizens when unsure of the threat posed by an Arab resident.

Once the security considerations had been taken care of and you were able to identify a subset of the Arab populations in Gaza, Judea, Samaria that posed no security threat, were willing to pledge allegiance to a Jewish state and would prefer to remain in Israel as a peaceful Arab minority than leave for a Arab majority nation state the next consideration becomes long term Israeli population demographics. As David Friedman, President Trump's Ambassador to Israel in his first term, discusses in his book "One Jewish State" (2024) a Jewish state is only viable in the long term if it has a Jewish majority and one suspects a significant Jewish majority to enshrine Jewish rights within a democracy permanently. He outlines the precedent of Puerto Rico where the United States maintains full sovereignty over the territory and its residents have US citizenship but without the right to vote in US national elections. There is a similar dynamic with some business corporations that have two classes of voting stock: Class A that have voting control of the company and Class B that does not. In the case that a subset of the Arab populations meeting robust criteria for Israeli citizenship was starting to cause Jewish majority concerns Israel could implement something similar for that subset. But the biblical passage from Numbers 33:55 serves as a warning to remain vigilant, not slip into suicidal empathy and not complacently collect pockets of thorns and thistles that will only serve to engender future intifadas and yet more unnecessary Jewish bloodshed.

## A defense of Judeo-Christian values: A marriage of old and new

The intersection or barrier between Judaism and Christianity presents an opportunity for those who seek to disrupt or overturn the Western global order. Convince Jews to be disdainful of the idol worshipping Christians and convince Christians to despise the Jews for killing a fellow Jew (Jesus) or having a superiority complex, turn the old against the new and feast on the chaos as the Western global order crumbles. In reality there is no reason why Judaism and Christianity can't be complements. Judaism doesn't scale to billions of people whilst Christianity does. Judaism doesn't proselytize whilst Christianity does. Judaism as a generalization perceives itself as an ethnicity, as a people with a deep connection to the Holy Land in addition to an effective religion whilst Christianity perceives itself as exclusively a religion for any people in any land. Jews had a relationship with G\*d prior to Jesus and hence don't believe that "No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6) but Christians didn't and hence do. Jews lived their lives according to the commandments of the Torah (Old Testament) prior to Jesus and didn't see the need to start afresh on the emergence of Jesus. Today when Jews and Christians work together the old Holy Land is secured from internal and external threats and new technologies connect the world and help humanity explore the stars. The question of whether the barrier between Judaism and Christianity is an absorbing one (blocking movement) or a permeable one (allows some diffusion) is a challenging one. Judaism has an insecurity over numbers which Christianity doesn't have and seeks to not lose Jews to assimilation or intermarriage. It is possible for a non-Jew to convert to Judaism but it is deliberately made arduous to ensure they are converting for the right reasons and won't later revert back to their prior lifestyle and belief system. In comparison Christianity is relatively easy to convert to. Without Judaism there would have been no Jesus and without Christianity there would be little of the Western civilization and order that Israel was reborn into in the 20th century.

Disdain or antipathy towards Judaism from the perspective of Christianity makes very little sense. Judaism not proselytizing and not attempting to introduce a new prophet to reduce the centrality of Jesus ensures it isn't a threat. Without an ethnic motivation or some other force for deeper curiosity Judaism's 613 commandments seem overbearing and unnecessary. Once you have a human representation of G\*d on earth (Jesus) with a face, a voice and a life story it is difficult to go back to attempting a connection with an infinite being without a face, voice or life story from the confines of the relatively tiny and limited human mind. However, that is what Judaism attempts. No matter how supposedly mundane the human action is; whether it be entering a room through a door, going to the toilet or waking from sleep, Judaism attempts through touching a Torah parchment (mezuzah), reciting a blessing or putting on a headcovering (kippah) to elevate that action to something approaching holiness, recognizing the hand of G\*d in everything we take for granted. It is difficult for a Christian worshipping the same G\*d to sneer at these traditions that were designed as a regular reminder of G\*d's presence, were most likely completed by Jesus during his lifetime and that instill gratitude for even the most basic of needs being met. Even if that Christian doesn't feel obligated to follow those traditions themselves after the instruction of Jesus and his disciples.

"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of G\*d" Mark 10:25

However, what is colloquially known as the West and the Christian world has not been in worse shape since the Great Depression and World War 2. A perfect storm of quantitative easing (money printing), winner take all dynamics with internet companies, a rootless global billionaire class who have extricated themselves from  nationalities and nation states and perhaps most importantly religion and G\*d in addition to the cover ups of child sexual exploitation from Jeffrey Epstein to the Muslim grooming gangs in the UK have left the West financially and morally bankrupt. The internet that initially started as a new world of opportunity for hackers and hobbyists and generated unimaginable riches for billionaires like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Andreessen is now wielded by those same individuals to control public opinion, censor discussion, push cryptocurrency scams and misdirect the potential next generation of hackers and hobbyists into thinking their skills are no longer useful. The tendency to idol worship which Jews have always been suspicious of now has everyone from senior politicians to teenagers desperate for a like or retweet from Elon Musk like beggars scrabbling for coins thrown in their direction. As their wealth and power spirals they become more and more disconnected from the person they were when they were working day and night to build their companies and pull the ladders up so their younger equivalents can't embark on a similar path. The masses are increasingly impoverished, desperate and manipulated by their base desires with no avenues to materially change anything about their societies that seem to sinking inexorably into the morass. Israel was reborn into Western civilization but there is increasingly less and less that Western civilization has to offer it other than a cautionary tale on what not to do. Although one hopes the reelection of President Trump will present a turning point it is also dangerous to pin your entire hopes on one flawed if potentially transformative 78 year old man and fall into the same idol worship trap as the attention beggars on Twitter with Musk.

## Does the Jewish state believe in Judaism?

"Belief is a gritty, potent, primordial force. In the 1950s a scientist named Dr. Curt Richter proved this when he gathered dozens of rats and dropped them into thirty inch deep glass cylinders filled with water. The first rat paddled on the surface for a short time, then swam to the bottom where it looked for an escape hatch. It died within two minutes. Several others followed that same pattern. Some lasted as long as 15 minutes but they all gave up. Richter was surprised because rats are damn good swimmers yet in his lab they drowned without much of a fight. So he tweaked the test. After he placed the next batch in their jars Richter watched them and right before it looked like they were about to give up he and his techs scooped up the rats, toweled them off and held them long enough for their heart and respiratory rates to normalize. Long enough for them to register on a physiological scale that they had been saved. They did this a few times before Richter placed a group of them back into those evil cylinders again to see how long they would last on their own. This time the rats didn't give up. They swam their natural asses off for an average of 60 hours without any food or rest. One swam for 81 hours." David Goggins (Never Finished)

When flailing in metaphorical waters it is inevitable that a human starts to ask themselves existential questions like why am I suffering, what is the point (if any) to my suffering and for how long am I willing to continue suffering for. Viktor Frankl describes in Man's Search For Meaning how the "wire", an electrically charged barbed wire fence presented a daily opportunity to end the suffering in the concentration camp of Auschwitz. Through this rather bleak experiment (Richter was effectively playing the role of G\*d and was more than willing to let the rats be fooled by false hope and ultimately perish) Richter demonstrated that what ultimately mattered to the rats and was the difference between giving up within 15 minutes or persisting for up to 81 hours was their belief that their suffering was not only being observed by a higher power but could be assuaged by a higher power. The biggest question humans are ultimately faced with is does such a higher power exist? If it doesn't and one is certain of it there is very little reason to prolong the suffering beyond the metaphorical 15 minutes. Ultimately the suffering is meaningless. Perhaps the suffering diminishes over time but if it doesn't and you can't see a route out of that suffering the checking out after 15 minutes might seem preferable to eventually checking out after 81 hours. Alternatively if one suspects there is a higher power but has no idea what form this higher power takes the natural follow up question is is this higher power benevolent and does it care about me, is it indifferent to my plight like Richter with his rats or worse is it downright malevolent and seeks to maximize my suffering? You are now in the terrain of religion and seeking to understand as best you can with your limited human brain the higher power, what in Judaism or Christianity would call G\*d.

Once you move up the levels of abstraction from the individual to the level of the nation state you could ask a similar question. What for example does Israel believe? Does it believe that it is just one of many nation states littered around the world that aspires to offer a Western level of modernity and security to its citizens? Or does it have a higher purpose? What should the priority be? Progress towards the rebuilding of a Third Temple to worship G\*d and orientate the religious community around or improved economic arrangements with its Arab neighbors? Does it model itself on an American state and effectively be "another star in the American flag" which Ben-Gvir insisted it was not? Or is it a Jewish state with biblically ordained borders oriented around Judaism and prioritizes its objectives based on that belief system even if it diverges from American objectives and quasi Christian morals? Ultimately does it believe in G\*d and that G\*d wants Israel, no matter what the human opposition is, to build an authentically Jewish state with G\*d and the Torah at its center and to fulfill being that "light unto the nations" (Isaiah 42:6)? Because if G\*d doesn't exist, the biblical stories are mere fiction and the Third Temple is a pipedream for the crazy religious fundamentalists that the Americans and the Arabs will never allow what sustains the modern reincarnation of Israel past its initial 15 minutes of flailing around in the violent and dangerous waters of the Middle East?

Without the belief in a higher power something has to inevitably fill the void. You cannot decide on what should be prioritized consciously or subconsciously without being led by some kind of lodestar. There has to be a reason why you get out the bed in the morning or why you complete activities that don't bring instant pleasure and/or joy. Some lodestars are healthier and more honorable than others. Providing for children and a family is a healthier lodestar than say maximizing personal pleasure ignoring the consequences on others. Caring about your personal legacy and wanting to remain relevant after you've died is a healthier lodestar than mindlessly maximizing your personal financial wealth by harming others and impoverishing your fellow citizens. However, even these examples of relatively healthier lodestars are still substituting personal ego into the void of where belief in a higher power would otherwise be. A higher power like Richter with his rats would be able to observe the entire system and see where ensuring your lazy, entitled children are billionaires is not necessarily a net good for the rest of society. A higher power would be able to see where a political leader was prioritizing his political survival or personal legacy over what was best for his country in the long term. The most significant question is whether there is a higher power or not because everything flows from it. If you believe in one you obviously don't throw out your responsibilities to your children or stop caring about what your personal legacy is going to be. But that is not the ultimate lodestar. The ultimate lodestar is what that higher power expects from you and why that higher power put you on this planet in the first place. The Torah lays out what a higher power wants and expects from Israel. Ignoring that and filling the void with other motivational factors may be better than some of the alternatives but it is not optimal. Again what remains of Israel if you throw out G\*d, the Torah and Judaism? What was the point of surviving and persisting through two millennia of exile and suffering? What was the point of the century of bloodshed and toil to reestablish the nation state of Israel? The ultimate lodestar has always been the higher power.

"When you get to heaven, let's say that's true, let's say G\*d does know all, and when you get there G\*d has a chart and the chart has your name on it. That chart tells you what you should have been and you missed the mark by a lot. When you get to heaven are you really in heaven or are you in hell? So my mindset now, with all that being said is, I do believe that G\*d has a chart up there and I know that G\*d knows all and that puts the fear of G\*d in me.... I want to exceed even G\*d's expectations of what he thought I was capable of. I want G\*d to be up there saying "I don't believe it. Not even I saw what David Goggins was capable of." That's the mindset that we all need to have for the rest of our lives. We need to shoot for more than what we even thought was possible." David Goggins (Can't Hurt Me)

Most of the problems afflicting Israel today are not rocket science. Humanity knows how to build prisons and knows how to deport individuals that pose a threat to the security of the nation state and the safety of its citizens. It knows how to build constructions like the Third Temple and indeed has known for many centuries. If 50 years from now Israel is still fighting waves of terrorism from within and is still offering to trade away its lands to appease the terrorists it will be because its leaders prioritized their self interest, financial gain and allegiances to other nation states over G\*d, the Jewish state and Judaism. G\*d's chart will show the Jewish people missed the mark by a lot let alone shooting for more than what was thought possible. As with the Holocaust, the terrorist attacks of October 7th present an opportunity for a new beginning and finally pursuing the correct path that Kahane laid out nearly 50 years ago. If it continues to trade away G\*d's inheritance and aspirations for the Jewish state there will be more Holocausts and there will be more October 7ths. And Israel's leaders will have no one to blame but themselves.

## Via Negativa

In Nassim Taleb's Antifragile he discusses the concept of "via negativa" where the solution to overcoming entrenched challenges is commonly to strip away everything and everyone that don't align with the ultimate goal so that time and effort isn't wasted on the roadblocks and those who are indifferent or adversarial to that ultimate goal. He describes the process of Michelangelo carving the statue of David using the simple maxim "I just remove everything that is not David". Similarly in political systems failing to remove the bad guy can cause more harm than the progress made by the collective actions of the good guys. The Holy Temple in Jerusalem contained a Holy of Holies, the innermost part and G\*d's dwelling place, which only the High Priest was allowed access to and only at specific times. You wouldn't allow the sinful or enemies of the Jewish state into the Holy of Holies and yet other institutions that are supposedly working on behalf of the Jewish state such as Israel's Parliament, the Knesset, contain representatives that want to give away Israel's land bequeathed by G\*d, foster fledgling terrorist states on its borders and are indifferent to directly or indirectly facilitating large scale terrorist attacks happening within Israel over and over again, year on year, decade on decade. The Knesset will never be a Holy Temple let alone a Holy of Holies but whilst it bans truth tellers like Kahane, defers to unelected bureaucrats rather than elected representatives and accepts breaking up the state to form adversarial new ones as a valid topic of discussion it will never make progress towards its ultimate goals. It will forever be a place that rubberstamps generation after generation being subject to terrorism and progress towards a Third Temple being stunted by those who don't have the interests of the Jewish state at heart in the first place.
